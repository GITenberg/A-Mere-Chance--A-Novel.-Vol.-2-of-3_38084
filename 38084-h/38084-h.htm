<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-m.jpg" alt="M"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">M</span>R. KINGSTON, as soon as he
received Mrs. Thornley's invitation,
sent a telegram to her
nearest post-town, to tell her he would
start for Adelonga on the following
day, and await at the inn where he left
the railway the buggy she was kind
enough to say should be sent to meet him.</p>

<p>There was much amusement at<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
Adelonga over this unwonted promptitude
on the part of an idle and self-indulgent
man, who had never been known
to hurry himself, or to go into the
country willingly; and Rachel was teased
in fun and congratulated in earnest on
the strong hold she had gained upon
his erewhile erratic affections.</p>

<p>The buggy was ordered at once&mdash;Mr.
Thornley's own pet Abbott buggy,
that floated over the rough roads&mdash;and
a pet pair of horses were harnessed
into it, and another pair sent
forward to change with them on the
way, and Mr. Thornley himself set forth
to meet his guest.</p>

<p>Next day Lucilla ordered one of
her best rooms&mdash;usually reserved for
married ladies&mdash;to be prepared for
him, and had great consultations with<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
her cook on his behalf; and at
about five in the afternoon he arrived,
wrapped in a fur-collared overcoat, like
a traveller in bleak and barren regions,
and had a royal welcome.</p>

<p>Lucilla, followed by her mother, went
out to the verandah to meet her old
friend&mdash;though, indeed, she never willingly
omitted that graceful act of
hospitality, whoever might be her guest&mdash;and
was delighted to receive again
the same old compliment on her charming
appearance that had pleasantly
befooled her in her maiden days. Mrs.
Hardy was likewise greeted with effusion,
and responded cordially; and then
they all looked round.</p>

<p>"Where is Rachel?" inquired Mr.
Kingston, with anxious solicitude; "isn't
she well?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>Rachel was found in the drawing-room,
nervously rearranging the cups and
saucers that had just been brought in for
tea. Lucilla ushered him in with a smile,
and discreetly retired with her mother,
upon some utterly unnecessary errand.</p>

<p>The lovers met in the middle of the
room, and Rachel went through the
ordeal that she had been vaguely
dreading all day. It was worse than
she had expected, for she felt, by
some subtle, newly-developed sense,
that she had been greatly missed and
ardently longed for, and that they
were truly lover's arms that folded her,
trembling and shrinking, in that apparently
interminable embrace.</p>

<p>She had not yet come to realise
the magnitude and the ignominy of the
wrong that she was doing him, but a<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
pang of remorseful pity did hurt her
somewhere, through all her stony irresponsiveness,
for the fate that had driven
him, the desired of so many women, to
set his heart at last upon one who did
not want it.</p>

<p>For a brief intolerable moment she
felt that she had it in her to implore
him to release her from her
engagement, but&mdash;well, she was a
little coward, if the truth must be told.</p>

<p>And, moreover, she had not quite come
to the point of giving up her pink
boudoir, and her diamond necklace,
and all her other splendid possessions
in prospect, because she could not love
the contingent husband as was her duty
to him to do.</p>

<p>She did not know as yet that she
loved another man.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>"And you never came to meet me?"
said Mr. Kingston, with tender reproach,
as he led her by one reluctant hand to
a sofa that was wheeled up comfortably
to the fireside. "And I was straining my
eyes all across the paddock, to see you on
the verandah looking out."</p>

<p>"I was looking out," said Rachel; "I
saw the buggy before it reached the
woolshed. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you thought it would be nicer
to have our meeting here, with no
one to look on? So it is, darling;
you were quite right. I could not have
helped kissing you, if all the servants on
the place had been standing round; and
one doesn't like to make a public exhibition
of one's self. Oh, my pet, I <i>am</i> so
glad to get you again! And how are
you? Let me have a good look at you.<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
Oh, if you are going to blush, how am I to
tell whether you are looking well or
not?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to blush,"
said Rachel; "and I am quite
well. I never was better. The
country air is doing me ever so much
good."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," rejoined Mr.
Kingston, rather gravely, stroking her
soft cheek. "You look fagged, as if
you had been knocking about too much.
I didn't like your going to those rubbishy
little races&mdash;I told Thornley so. Have
you been sitting up late at night?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I have been doing <i>nothing</i>,"
pleaded Rachel; "I am really as well as
possible. How is the house getting on?"</p>

<p>"The house is not doing much at
present. They are still pottering at the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
foundations, which seem to take a frightful
lot of doing to. Not that they have
had time to make much progress since you
were there&mdash;it is not much over a
fortnight yet, you know. Oh, but it has
been a long fortnight! Rachel, now I
have got you, I don't mean to lose
sight of you again."</p>

<p>"How did you leave Beatrice?" inquired
Rachel, hastily.</p>

<p>"Beatrice is quite well&mdash;as sprightly
as ever. I told her I meant to bring
you back to town, by force of arms if
necessary, and she said I was quite right.
We can't do without you in Melbourne&mdash;I
can't, anyhow; and what's more, I
don't mean to try."</p>

<p>"How is Uncle Hardy?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Hardy? I'm sure I don't
know&mdash;I was very nearly saying I don't<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
care. Of course he is quite well; he
always is, I believe. Is there anybody
else you are particularly anxious about,
Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rachel, smiling and blushing;
"I am anxious about Black Agnes.
How is my dear Black Agnes? <i>Does</i>
William attend to her properly?"</p>

<p>"I don't leave her to William," said
Mr. Kingston. "I have taken her away
to my own stables. And there she is
eating her head off&mdash;wanting you, like the
rest of us. If you have no more
questions to ask, I'll begin; may I? I
have some <i>really</i> important inquiries to
make."</p>

<p>Rachel gasped. But to her immense
relief Lucilla was heard approaching,
talking at an unnecessarily high pitch of
voice to her mother, who responded with<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
equal vigour; and the two ladies entered,
followed by Mr. Thornley, all wearing a
more or less deprecatory aspect.</p>

<p>The men and the matrons grouped
themselves round the fire, and plunged
into an animated discussion of the latest
Melbourne news. Rachel poured out the
tea, and insisted on carrying it round to
everybody, regardless of polite protests;
which charmed her lover very much.</p>

<p>He was rather cold, and a little stiff
and tired after his unwonted exertion;
his seat was soft and restful; and he liked
to see the slender creature gliding
about, with her sweet face and her
deft hands, and picture to himself with
what meek dutifulness she would serve
her lord and master when the time
came.</p>

<p>Rachel hoped they were in for a<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
pleasant gossip till dinner time, but she
was much mistaken.</p>

<p>"I must go and see after my baby,
Mr. Kingston, if you will excuse me,"
said Lucilla at the end of half-an-hour,
setting down her empty but still smoking
teacup, and rising with an air that
implied a pressing duty postponed to
the very last moment. Mr. Kingston
expressed an ardent desire to make the
baby's acquaintance, which flattered the
young mother greatly, but otherwise
led to nothing. Lucilla went out,
promising to introduce her son under
favourable auspices in the morning;
and as she disappeared, Mrs. Hardy
jumped up and followed her with apparently
anxious haste.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lucilla, I <i>quite</i> forgot that
aconite for Dolly's cold!" she exclaimed;<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
"shall I come and look for it
now?"</p>

<p>Mr. Thornley, left behind, stood on
the hearthrug, shifting uneasily from
one leg to the other. He cleared his
throat, remarked that the days were
lengthening wonderfully, moved some
ornaments on the chimney-piece, and
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Dear me," he muttered briskly, as
if struck with a sudden thought, "a
quarter to six, I do declare! Excuse
me a few minutes, Kingston."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Mr. Kingston.
And then <i>he</i> went out.</p>

<p>"How stupid they are!" cried poor
Rachel to herself, almost stamping her
foot with vexation. But there was no
help for it. The affianced couple were
once more left to themselves&mdash;as affianced<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
couples should be, and should like to be&mdash;in
the pleasant firelight and no less
pleasant twilight shadows that were
filling the quiet room.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingston rose, took his reluctant
sweetheart's hand, and led her back
to the sofa by the hearth.</p>

<p>"What time do they have dinner
here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Seven o'clock," said Rachel, with a
sinking heart.</p>

<p>"Then we shall have nearly an hour
to ourselves, shan't we? Come then,
and let us have a good long talk.
But first, I've got something for
you."</p>

<p>He began to fumble in his pockets,
and presently drew forth a little square
packet, neatly sealed up in paper,
which he laid on Rachel's knee. Wise<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
man! he had not had his long and
varied experiences for nothing.</p>

<p>The girl in smiling perplexity turned
the mysterious parcel over and over,
broke first one seal and then another
with much delicate elaboration; cautiously
stripped off the paper wrappings,
and revealed, as she expected, a morocco
jewel-case.</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind!" she murmured,
stroking it caressingly with her white
fingers.</p>

<p>"Open it before you say that," said
he; "you don't know that there is
anything in it yet."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I know your ways," she
rejoined; "I know it is sure to be
something lovely." And then she lifted
the lid, and exclaimed "O-o-oh!" with
a long breath. There lay, on a bed of<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
blue velvet, a beautiful little watch,
thickly set on one side of the case
with tiny diamond sparks, which on
examination proved to illuminate the
flourishes of a big R; and a chain
of proportionate value was coiled around
it.</p>

<p>Rachel was in ecstacies. She had
longed for a watch all her life, and
had never yet had one, except an old
silver warming-pan of her father's,
which would not go into a lady's
pocket.</p>

<p>It was only lately that Mr. Kingston
had discovered this fact; and he had
immediately had one prepared for her,
such as he considered would be worthy
of her future position in society, and
of his own reputation for good taste.
He felt himself well repaid for his<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
outlay at this moment. Of her own
accord she put up her soft lips and
kissed him, pouring out her childish
gratitude for his thoughtfulness, and
his kindness, and his goodness, in
broken exclamations which were charmingly
na&iuml;ve and sweet.</p>

<p>"You are always giving me things,"
she murmured, shyly stroking his coat
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Dear little woman!" he responded,
with ardent embraces, from which she
did not shrink&mdash;at least, not much; "it
is my greatest pleasure in life to give
you things."</p>

<p>And from this substantial base of
operations the astute lover opened
the campaign which was to deliver
her, a helpless captive, into his
hands.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>"And now," he said, when the watch
having been consigned to its pocket in
her pretty homespun gown, and the
chain artistically festooned from a
button-hole at her waist, a suggestive
silence fell upon them&mdash;"now I want
to know what you mean by saying
you won't be married till next year?
Naughty child, you made me very
miserable with that letter. Though to
be sure it was better than the other
one, which was so horribly, so really
brutally, cold that I had to go to the
fire to get warm after reading it. Oh,
Rachel, you are not <i>half</i> in love yet, I
fear!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that," she murmured, with
tender compunction.</p>

<p>"And I believe that is why you wish
to put off our marriage."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" she repeated,
weakly anxious to re-assure and conciliate
him, and to postpone unpleasantness&mdash;woman-like,
afraid of the very
opportunity that she wanted when she
saw herself unexpectedly confronted
with it. "I don't wish to put it off&mdash;only
for a little while."</p>

<p>"Do you call till next year a little
while? Because I don't."</p>

<p>"Of course it is. Why, here is
August!"</p>

<p>"And there are five long months&mdash;double
the time we have been engaged
already. And it wouldn't be comfortable
to be travelling in the hot
season."</p>

<p>"You said spring would be a nice
time," suggested Rachel. She was
touching his sleeve with timid, deprecatory<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
caresses, and she was desperately
frightened and anxious.</p>

<p>"Yes; <i>this</i> spring&mdash;not twelve months
hence. Oh, my pet, <i>do</i> let it be this
spring. There are three lovely months
before us, and I should like to get
that Sydney house. I have the offer
of it still for a few days; I got them
to keep it open till I could consult
you. You <i>must</i> remember that I am
not as young as you are, Rachel; a year
one way or the other may be of no
account to you, but it is of very great
importance to me."</p>

<p>There was a touch of impatience
and irritation in his voice, which helped
her to pluck up courage to cling to
her resolve.</p>

<p>At the same time she heard the soft
ticking of that precious watch at her<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
side; her heart was touched and warmed
by what she called his "kindness;"
and she was anxious to do anything
that she <i>could</i> do to please him.</p>

<p>"Won't it do when the house is
built?" she asked, in a wheedling,
cowardly, coaxing tone, as she laid her
cheek for a moment on his shoulder.
"I will come back to Melbourne as
soon as you like&mdash;I can stay with
Beatrice, if aunt likes to remain here.
We can be together almost as if we
were married. We can ride together
every day, and watch how the house
goes on; and you know aunt doesn't
mind <i>how</i> much you are with us at
Toorak. Only if you would consent to
put off the wedding till then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you promise to marry me then?"
he asked quickly.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, I will, really," she replied,
without any hesitation, thankful for the
reprieve, which she had been by no
means sure of getting.</p>

<p>"As soon as the house is built?"</p>

<p>"As soon as the house is finished."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not finished; that mayn't be
next year, nor the year after. As soon
as the roof is on?"</p>

<p>Rachel paused.</p>

<p>"How long does that take?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a long time&mdash;ever so long."</p>

<p>She paused again, with a longer pause.
And then,</p>

<p>"Very well," she sighed, resignedly.</p>

<p>"It is a bargain? You promise
faithfully? On your solemn word of
honour?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't make such a terrible
thing of it!" she protested, with a rather<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
hysterical laugh, that showed signs of
degenerating into a whimper. "I <i>can</i>
only say I will."</p>

<p>"And that is enough, my sweet. I
won't require you to reduce it to
writing. Your word shall be your bond.
It is a long while to wait, but I must
try to be patient. At any rate, it is
a comfort to be done with uncertainty,
and to have a fixed time to arrange
for. And now, perhaps, we ought to
go and dress. Tell me how much it
wants to seven, Rachel; you have the
correct Melbourne time."</p>

<p class="h3">THE BEGINNING OF TROUBLES.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-i.jpg" alt="I"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">I</span>T was in the afternoon that
Lucilla again expected her
guests, on the day of the
ball given at Adelonga in honour of
the coming of age of her absent stepson;
and the hospitable arrangements
characteristic of bush households on
such occasions, were made for their
reception on the usual Adelonga scale.
All the visitors were to be "put up"
of course; and from the exhaustless<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
piles of material stowed away in the
ample store-rooms, bed-rooms were improvised
in every hole and corner, and
beds made up wherever beds could
decently go&mdash;in the store-rooms themselves,
in the school-room, in the
laundry, in the gardener's cottage, as
well as in the numerous guest-chambers
with which this, in common with other
Australian "country seats," was regularly
supplied.</p>

<p>Bright log fires burned on every
hearth; bright spring flowers adorned
all the ladies' dressing-tables; stupendous
viands piled the pantry shelves and
filled the spacious kitchens with delectable
odours.</p>

<p>Servants bustled about with a festive
air.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornley, in shirt sleeves, brought<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
forth treasures from the remote recesses
of his cellar that no one but he was
competent to meddle with.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornley moved complacently
about her extensive domain, regulating
all these exceptional arrangements with
that housewifely good sense and judgment
which distinguished all Mrs. Hardy's
daughters.</p>

<p>Rachel found her sphere of action in
the ball-room, where with Miss O'Hara
and the children, a young gardener to
supply material, the station carpenter
to do the rough work, and Mr.
Kingston to look on and criticise from
an arm-chair by the fire, she worked
all day at the decorations, which had
been designed in committee and partly
prepared the day before. The great
Japanese screens had been carried away<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
(to be made very useful in the construction
of bed and bath-rooms) and
the carpets taken up; and now she
feathered the great empty room all
about with fern-tree fronds&mdash;hanging
them from extemporised chandeliers, and
from wire netting stretched over the
ceiling, and from doorless doorways,
rooted in masses of shrubs and blossoms
that made a bower of the whole place.
It was just such a task as she delighted
in, and she was considered to have
completed it successfully at four o'clock,
when she put her finishing touches
to a trophy over the chimney-piece,
which, though rather complicated as
to symbolism, being arranged on a
foundation of breech-loaders and riding-whips,
had a bold and pleasing
effect.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>At four o'clock the guests began to
arrive. She was directing her attendants
to sweep up the last of her litters from
the newly-polished floor, when the Digbys'
waggonette drove in at the wide-standing
garden gates, and rattled up
to the house.</p>

<p>After them came other buggies in
quick succession. Grooms and house
servants poured out to receive them;
doors banged; confused voices and
laughter rose and fell in waves of
pleasant sound through the maze of
passages intersecting the rabbit-warren
of a house.</p>

<p>Rachel ran to a window and looked
out in time to see Lucifer led off to
the stables blowing and panting, and
jangling his bridle, but stepping out
still with unconquered spirit, as became<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
a brave old horse of noble lineage, whom
such a master owned.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingston, the only other person
just then in the room, came behind her
and laid his hands with the air of a
proprietor on her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Whose hack is that?" he inquired,
with languid curiosity. "Looks a good
sort of breed, something like your mare
in colour, only much bigger."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dalrymple's," murmured Rachel.</p>

<p>"Dalrymple?&mdash;that brother of Mrs.
Digby's you spoke of? I've heard of
that fellow. I was curious to know
who he was, and I made inquiries at
the club. He is a rather considerable
scamp, if all tales are true."</p>

<p>"All tales are not true," replied the
girl, with majestic calmness.</p>

<p>"And pray how do <i>you</i> know?" he<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
retorted quickly, a little amused and a
great deal irritated by her highly indiscreet
behaviour. "I don't suppose
that you have heard all that I have&mdash;at
any rate, I <i>hope</i> not."</p>

<p>"I know enough," she stammered
hurriedly; "I know the worst anyone
can say against him."</p>

<p>"I hope not," repeated Mr. Kingston,
with ominous gravity.</p>

<p>"And I know he has done wrong&mdash;done
very wrong, indeed; but he
has had such terrible provocations&mdash;he
has been, oh, so dreadfully unfortunate!"
she went on, wishing heartily
that she had not undertaken her new
friend's defence, yet finding it easier
to go through with it now than to
turn back and desert him. "And,
whatever he may have been once, he<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
is doing nothing to harm anybody
now; and it is cruel of people to be
always raking up the past, when it is
done with and repented of, and throwing
it in his teeth. Any of us would
think it hard and unfair&mdash;you would
yourself."</p>

<p>"Never mind me, my dear; my past
is not being called in question that I
am aware of."</p>

<p>Mr. Kingston's not very placid temper
was rising.</p>

<p>"He is doing nothing wrong now,"
she repeated, frightened but reckless;
"if he were, Mr. Thornley would not
invite him here&mdash;he said so himself.
And Lucilla, though she does not like
him&mdash;nobody likes him, indeed&mdash;says
he would never do a mean action,
and that he has perfect manners,<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
and that he is a thorough gentleman
every way. I think they all agree about
<i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"And yet don't like him. That is
rather inconsistent. And what about
yourself, Rachel? If it is not a rude
question&mdash;are you an exception in this
respect, or not?"</p>

<p>He had taken his hands from her
shoulders, and was standing sideways
in the embrasure of the window, so
that he could see her face; and he
was smiling in a most unpleasant
manner.</p>

<p>Rachel had never seen him like this
before, and the first seed of active
dislike was sown where as yet there
had been nothing worse than indifference.
The familiar colour rose and
flooded her white brow and her whiter<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
throat. She clenched her hands to still
the flutter of her heart. She shut her
teeth and struggled in silence against
an ignominious impulse to cry.</p>

<p>But Mr. Kingston continued to watch
her with that sardonic curiosity; and
presently, like the traditional worm, she
turned on him.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I am an exception.
I like Mr. Dalrymple very much&mdash;what
little I know of him. I have seen no
reason to do otherwise. I do not pay
any attention to vulgar gossip."</p>

<p>A timid woman, trying to be defiant,
generally fails by overdoing it; and so
did she, poor child. Mr. Kingston heard
the emphasis of strong emotion, that
she would have given worlds to keep
back, vibrating through her tremulous
accents, and it drove him beyond those<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
considerations of policy and politeness
which he made a boast of as his rule
of life and action&mdash;especially in his
dealings with women. Rachel, however,
in the category of women, was exceptionally
placed with respect to him; and
I suppose one must do him the justice
to concede that this was an exceptional
emergency.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," he said,
smiling no longer, and speaking with
a rough edge to his voice that betokened
the original rude nature,
usually so carefully clothed, and that
she instinctively resented as an indignity,
"Thornley can do as he likes
about the people he brings here to
associate with his wife, but I won't
have you making acquaintance with a
vagabond like that."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>"I have already made his acquaintance,"
she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Then I beg you will break it
off."</p>

<p>"How can I break it off while he
is in the same house with me?"</p>

<p>She was surprised to find how
strong she was to withstand this
incipient tyranny; and yet her heart
contracted with a pain very like despair.</p>

<p>"There will be so many people
that one&mdash;and he a man&mdash;may be
easily avoided, if you wish to avoid.
And you <i>will</i> wish to do what would
please me, wouldn't you, dear?" he
demanded, perceiving that he was
bullying her, and trying to correct
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "certainly. But<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
I hope you will not ask me to be
rude to one of my cousin's guests. I
don't mind what else I do to please
you. And when I am married, I will
of course know nobody but the people
you like."</p>

<p>"You are as good as married to
me already," he said, putting his arm
round her shoulder as she stood before
him, with all sorts of changes
and revolutions going on within her.
"And of course I don't want you to
be rude&mdash;I don't want you to be
anything. Simply don't take any notice
of Dalrymple&mdash;he will quite understand
it; don't dance with him, or have anything
to do with him."</p>

<p>"Not dance with him!" she broke
out sharply.</p>

<p>Her evident dismay and disappointment,<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
together with her unconscious
efforts to evade his embrace, exasperated
his already ruffled temper
afresh.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he said, with angry
vehemence. "I shall be exceedingly annoyed
and vexed if I see you dancing
with that man."</p>

<p>Rachel did not know until now
how much she had secretly set her
heart upon doing this forbidden thing;
as her exigent lover did not know
until now that he had it in him to be
so horribly jealous.</p>

<p>"He will be sure to come and ask
me," she said, with a despairing
sigh.</p>

<p>"Very well. If he does, I beg you
will refuse him."</p>

<p>"Then I must refuse everybody."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>"Not at all. He will quite understand
that there are reasons why he
should be exceptionally treated."</p>

<p>"And do you think I will make
him understand <i>that</i>?" she burst out,
with pathetic indignation that filled
her soft eyes with tears. "Do you
think I would be so&mdash;so infamously
rude and cruel? Oh, Mr. Kingston"&mdash;she
never called him "Graham"
except in her letters, though he tried
his best to make her&mdash;"you don't
want to spoil all my pleasure to-night,
which was going to be such a happy
night?"</p>

<p>"Your pleasure doesn't depend on
dancing with Mr. Dalrymple, I <i>hope</i>."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no; but may I not treat him
like all the rest, for Lucilla's sake&mdash;for
common politeness' sake?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>"No, Rachel. I don't want to be
unkind, my dear, but you must remember
your position, and that now
you belong to me. A lady who understands
these matters can quite easily
manage to get off dancing with a
man if she wishes, without being rude.
You must learn those little social
accomplishments, and this is a very
good time to begin. Now let us
change the subject. Kiss me, and
don't look so miserable, or I shall
begin to think&mdash;but that it would
be insulting you too much&mdash;that you
have fallen in love with this disreputable
ruffian."</p>

<p>Mr. Kingston tried to assume a
light and airy manner, but his badinage
had a menacing tone that was very
chilling.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>Rachel, strange to say, did not
blush at all; she quietly excused herself
on the plea that she must go
and arrange her dishevelled costume,
and (having no private bedroom to-night)
went a long way down the
garden to a retired harbour for half
an hour's meditation.</p>

<p class="h3">"WHERE THERE WAS NEVER NEED OF VOWS."</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-w.jpg" alt="W"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">W</span>hen Rachel came back to the
house it was nearly five
o'clock.</p>

<p>There was to be a great high tea
at six, for which no dressing was
required, in place of the ordinary
dinner; and as she did not feel
inclined to meet the crowd of company
that was assembling in the drawing-room
sooner than was necessary&mdash;to
tell the truth, she had been<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
crying, and her eyes were red&mdash;she
returned by a back way
to the ball-room, which she knew
would be to all intents and purposes,
empty.</p>

<p>As an excuse for doing so she
carried in her arms some long wreaths
of spir&aelig;a which she had discovered
on a bush at the bottom of the
garden, with which she intended to
relieve the masses of box and laurestinus
that made the groundwork of
her decorations.</p>

<p>Lightly flitting up a stone-flagged
passage at the rear of the house, she
suddenly came upon Mr. Dalrymple.
He emerged from the door of the
laundry, which had been assigned to
him for sleeping quarters, just as she
was passing it.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried sharply, as if he
had been a ghost; and then she
caught her breath, and dropped her
eyes, and blushed her deepest blush,
which was by no means the conventional
mode of salutation, but more
than satisfied the man who did not
know until this moment how eagerly
he had looked for a welcome from
her.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" he said, clothing
the common formula with a new
significance, and holding her hand in
a strong grasp; "I was wondering
where you were, and beginning to
dread all kinds of disasters. Where
are you going? May I carry these
for you?"</p>

<p>He saw by this time the traces of
her recent tears, and the cheerful<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
cordiality of his greeting subsided to a
rather stern but very tender earnestness.</p>

<p>Silently he lifted the white wreaths
from her arm, and began to saunter
beside her in the direction of the
ball-room, much as he had led her
away into the conservatory on that
memorable night, which was only a
week, but seemed a year ago.</p>

<p>All the time she was thinking of
Mr. Kingston's prohibition, and dutifully
desiring to obey him; but she
had no power in her to do
more.</p>

<p>They passed through the servants'
offices, meeting only Lucilla's maid,
who was in a ferment of excitement
with so many ladies to attend to, and
had not a glance to spare for them;<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
they heard voices and footsteps all
around them as they entered the
house; but they reached the ball-room
unperceived and unmolested, and
found themselves alone.</p>

<p>The great room, with its windows
draped and garlanded, was dim and
silent; the gardener's steps stood in
the middle ready for the lighting of
the lamps; nothing but this remained
to be done, and no one came in to
disturb them.</p>

<p>For ten minutes they devoted themselves
to business. Mr. Dalrymple
mounted the steps, and wove the
spir&aelig;a into whatever green clusters
looked too thin or too dark; he
touched up certain devices that seemed
to him to lack stability; he straightened
some flags that were hanging<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
awry; and Rachel stood below and
offered humble suggestions.</p>

<p>When they had done, and had
picked up a few fallen leaves and
petals, they stood and looked round
them to judge of the general effect.</p>

<p>"It is very pretty," said Mr.
Dalrymple; "and it makes a capital
ball-room. I have not seen a better
floor anywhere."</p>

<p>"It was laid down on purpose for
dancing," said Rachel, who knew she
ought now to be making her appearance
elsewhere, yet lingered because
he did.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of dancing?" he
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "very."</p>

<p>"Will you give me your first waltz
to-night?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>He was leaning an elbow on the
piano, near which he stood, and looking
down on her with that gentle
but imperious inquiry in his eyes,
which made her feel as if she had
taken a solemn affidavit to tell the
truth.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot," she stammered, after
a pause, during which she wondered
distractedly how she could best explain
her refusal so as to spare him
unnecessary pain; "I am very sorry&mdash;I
would, with pleasure, if I
could."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, with a slight,
grateful bow. "Well, I could hardly
hope for the first, I suppose. But I
may have the second? Here are the
programmes," he added, fishing into a
basketful of them that stood on the<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
piano, and drawing two out; "let
me put my name down for the
second, and what more you can spare;
may I?"</p>

<p>She took the card he gave her,
opened it, looked at the little spaces
which symbolised so much more than
their own blank emptiness, looked up
at him, and then&mdash;alas! She was a
timid, tender, weakly creature when
she was hurt, and she had not yet
got over the effect of Mr. Kingston's
harshness; and she had been crying
too recently to be able to withstand
the slightest provocation to
cry.</p>

<p>She tried to speak, but her lip
quivered, and a tear that had been
slowly gathering fell with an audible
pat upon the piano. He drew the<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
card from her in a moment, and
at the same time swept away any
veil of decorous reticence that she
might have wished to keep about
her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked,
with gentle entreaty, which in him
was not inconsistent with a most
evident determination to find out. "<i>I</i>
am not distressing you, asking you to
dance with me, am I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;it is nothing! Only
please <i>don't</i> ask me," she almost
sobbed, struggling against the shame
that she was bringing on herself, and
knowing quite well that she would
struggle in vain.</p>

<p>He watched her in silence for half
a minute&mdash;not as Mr. Kingston had
watched her, though with even a<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
fiercer attentiveness, and then he said,
very quietly,</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>But he had already guessed.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;I have promised
not to."</p>

<p>"You have promised Mr. Kingston?"</p>

<p>Scarlet with pain and mortification,
in an agony of embarrassment, she
sighed almost inaudibly,</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not to dance with me? or merely
not to dance waltzes?"</p>

<p>"Must I tell you?" she pleaded,
looking up with appealing wet eyes
into his hard and haughty face.</p>

<p>"Not unless you like, Miss Fetherstonhaugh.
I think I understand perfectly."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Dalrymple, I want to tell
you about it, but I cannot. I am saying
things already that I ought not to
speak of."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," he replied
quickly, suddenly softening until his
voice was almost a caress, and set all
her sensitive nerves thrilling like an
&AElig;olian harp when a strong wind
blows over it. "It is in your nature
to be honest, and to tell the truth.
You are not afraid to tell the truth
to me?"</p>

<p>"I would not tell you an untruth,"
she murmured, looking down; "but
the truth&mdash;sometimes one must, sometimes
one ought&mdash;to hide it. And I
hoped you would not need to know
about this."</p>

<p>"Why, how could I help knowing<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
it? Did you think it likely I might
by chance forget you were in the ball-room
to-night?"</p>

<p>What she thought clearly "blazed
itself in the heart's colours on her
simple face." But she did not lift her
eyes or speak.</p>

<p>"I am very glad I know," he continued,
in a rather stern tone. "If
you had done this to me, and never
told me why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should have trusted to you to
guess that it was not my fault, and
to forgive me for it," the girl interposed,
looking up at last with a
flash in her soft eyes that, as well
as her words, told him a great deal
more than she had any idea
of.</p>

<p>"It was really so?" he demanded<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
eagerly. "It was not your own desire
to disappoint me so terribly?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>no</i>."</p>

<p>"If you had been left to yourself
you would have danced with
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Quite willingly?"</p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> I would!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dalrymple drew a long breath.
It was rather a critical moment.
But he was no boy, at the mercy
of the wind and waves of his own
emotions, and Rachel's evident weakness
of self-control was an appeal
to his strength that he was not the
man to disregard. Still it was wonderful
how actively during these last
few minutes he had come to hate
Mr. Kingston, whom he had never seen.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>"I suppose," he said presently, "I
must not ask the reason for this preposterous
proceeding?"</p>

<p>"Do not," she pleaded gently.
"There is no reason, really. It is but
Mr. Kingston's whim."</p>

<p>"And are you determined to sacrifice
me to Mr. Kingston's whim?"</p>

<p>She did not speak, and he repeated
his query in a more imperious
fashion.</p>

<p>"Are you really going to throw
me over altogether, Miss Fetherstonhaugh?
I only want to know."</p>

<p>She looked up at him piteously, and
he softened at once.</p>

<p>"Tell me what I am to do," he
said, in a low voice. "<i>Do</i> you wish
me not to ask you for any dances?
It is a horrible thing&mdash;it is enough<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
to make me wish I had gone to
Queensland on Monday, after all&mdash;but
I will not bother you. Tell me, am I
not to ask you at all?"</p>

<p>"If you please," she whispered
with a quick sigh, full of despairing
resignation. "I am very sorry, but it
is right to do what Mr. Kingston wishes."</p>

<p>"That is not my view in this
case. However, it is right for <i>me</i>
to do what <i>you</i> wish. And I will,
though it is very hard."</p>

<p>Here Rachel, feeling all her body
like one great beating heart, moved
away to the door, driven by a stern
sense of social duty.</p>

<p>Her companion did not follow her,
and she paused on the threshold,
turned round, and then suddenly
hurried back to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>"Mr. Dalrymple," she said, putting
out her hand with an impulsive
gesture, "do not wish you had gone
to Queensland instead of coming here
to-night. If you do I shall be <i>miserable</i>!"</p>

<p>He seized her hand immediately, and
stooping his tall head at the same
moment, brushed it with his moustache.
Then, looking up into her scared face,
he said&mdash;like a man binding himself by
some terrible oath:</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> I never will."</p>

<p>Once before in that room they had
touched the point where not only mere
acquaintance but warmest friendship
ends. Then it had been to her a new,
incomprehensible experience; now she
could not help seeing the reason and
the meaning of it, though, perhaps, not
so clearly as he.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>In a moment she had drawn her
hand away, and like a bird frightened
from its nest, had vanished out of his
sight, leaving him&mdash;thoroughly aroused
from his normal impassiveness&mdash;gazing
at the empty doorway behind her.</p>

<p>When they met again, ten minutes
afterwards, it was in the drawing-room,
which was crowded with people; and
through all the crush and noise, she
was as acutely conscious of his presence
as if he alone had been there.</p>

<p>She moved about with tremulous restlessness
and downcast eyes; afraid to
look at him&mdash;afraid he should look at
her; paying her little civilities mechanically,
and conducting herself generally,
to her aunt's extreme annoyance, more
like a bashful schoolgirl and a poor
relation than ever.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Kingston, doing his best to fascinate
Miss Hale, who stood beside
him, giggling and simpering and twiddling
her watch-chain, looked anxiously
at his little sweetheart when she entered,
thought he saw signs of his own
handiwork in her disturbed and downcast
face, called her to him, and until
the great tea-dinner was over, and they
all had to disperse to dress, compassed
her with devout attentions, intended to
assure her of his royal forgiveness and
favour.</p>

<p>But he did not remove the prohibition,
which made her more and more
resentful as she continued to think
about it, and less and less responsive
to his ostentatious "kindness;" and he
treated Mr. Dalrymple&mdash;when he condescended
to acknowledge his presence<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
at all&mdash;with a supercilious rudeness
that Mr. Thornley, in conjugal confidence,
declared to be "very bad form,"
and that prompted the gentle Lucilla
to be "nicer" to the younger man than
Rachel had ever seen her. He was
so open in his hostility that it
was generally noticed and talked of
(and the cause of it more or less
correctly surmised).</p>

<p>The only person who seemed absolutely
indifferent to it and to him was Mr.
Dalrymple himself; and in his secret
heart he was much more glad than
angry to have earned such pronounced
dislike from such a quarter, though as
impatient of what he called "impudence"
as anybody.</p>

<p>That Adelonga ball was a memorable
event to most of the people that it<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
gathered together&mdash;as what ball is not?
Mr. Thornley celebrated the coming of
age of his son and heir, to begin with.
Mrs. Thornley appeared for the first
time, "officially," after the birth of her
baby, who was the hero of all occasions
to <i>her</i>, and inaugurated a great "county"
reputation as a charming hostess and
woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy got her best point lace
irretrievably ruined by catching it on
an unprotected corner of the wire-netting
upon which Rachel had worked
her decorations; and she also saw the
lamentable frustration of several wise
plans that she had made.</p>

<p>Two young people became engaged;
others, male and female, fell in love,
or began those pleasant flirtations which
led to love eventually.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>Miss Hale on the other hand, quarrelled
with Mr. Lessel, who took upon
himself to object to her extravagant
appreciation of Mr. Kingston's rather
extravagant attentions; and their engagement
was broken off.</p>

<p>Mr. Lessel at the same time captivated
the fancy of a charming young
lady, only daughter of the Adelonga
family doctor, resident in the township
close by, who was destined in less
than twelve months to be his
wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingston, surfeited with balls,
had a deeper interest in this one than
in any of the hundreds that he had
attended in the course of a long and gay
career.</p>

<p>Never before had he admired a pretty
woman with such ferocious sincerity as<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
he admired his little Rachel to-night;
never before had he used such rude
tactics to make the object of his affections
jealous&mdash;thereby to subdue rebellion
in her; never before had he been so
defied and circumvented by a being in
female shape as he was to-night by this
presumptive little nobody, whom he had
singled out for honour, and who was
bound to honour him, and his lightest
wish.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Dalrymple and Rachel&mdash;they
must be classed together in this
catalogue of special experiences, for they
shared theirs between them&mdash;the Adelonga
ball marked a new and very memorable
departure in the history of their lives.
For half the evening they danced
decorously apart.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalrymple justified Mrs. Thornley's<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
expectations, of course, and distinguished
himself above all the dancing men assembled;
Rachel, who had had but
little teaching, was a dancer by nature
and instinct, as light and effortless, as
airy and graceful as a bit of wind-blown
thistle-down.</p>

<p>She loved it, as she loved all pleasant
and poetic things; and though she could
not have the partner she wanted, and
had to take whom she could get, she
felt to-night, and more and more as
the evening wore away, that she had
never heard and felt, in the strains of
mere senseless instruments and in the
thrill of responsive pulses, music of
mundane waltzes and galops of such
inspired and impassioned beauty.</p>

<p>There was a young artist from Melbourne
who played lovely airs on a<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
violin to a piano accompaniment, and
he seemed literally to play upon her,
spiritually sensitive as she was to-night
to the lightest touch of that divine
afflatus which makes poetry of certain
passages in the most prosaic lives.</p>

<p>Now rapturously happy, now tragically
miserable, and tremulously fluctuating
up and down between these two
extremes, she was blown about like
a leaf in autumn wind by the subtle
harmonies of that magical violin. At
least she thought it was the violin.
We know better.</p>

<p>At about twelve o'clock she went into
the house on an errand for Lucilla,
and came back by way of the conservatory,
as the first bars of a
Strauss waltz were stealing through
the fern-roofed alleys, with nameless<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
tender associations in every liquid
note.</p>

<p>For a few seconds she paused in
the shadowy doorway, a slight, white
figure against the dim background, with
hair like a golden aureola, and milk-white
neck and arms&mdash;a gracious vision
of youth and beauty as prince could
wish to see.</p>

<p>But the Sleeping Princess now was
acutely wide awake; the life that ran
in her quickened pulses was almost
more than she could bear. Her eyes
shone restlessly, her breath fluttered
in her throat, her heart ached and
swelled with some vague, irresistible
passion, as the waves of that delicious
melody flowed over her, like an enchanter's
incantation.</p>

<p>A few paces off, within the ball-room,<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
Mr. Dalrymple stood with his back to
the wall watching her; his dark face
was lit and transfigured with the same
kind of solemn exaltation. She turned
her head, and they looked at one
another, mutually conscious of the
supreme moment that had unawares
arrived.</p>

<p>He held out his hand&mdash;she almost
sprang to meet him; and then, oblivious
of betrothals, and promises, and houses,
and diamonds, she floated down the
long room, under the very noses of
her aunt and Mr. Kingston, lying in
a reckless ecstasy of contentment in
her true love's arms.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-w.jpg" alt="W"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">W</span>HATEVER might have been
Rachel's confusion of mind as
to the nature and consequences
of her escapade, Mr. Dalrymple, from
the moment that he took her in his
arms, understood the situation perfectly.
It was sufficiently serious to a man in
his position, who, whatever his faults,
was the soul of honour; but it was
never his way to dally with difficulties,
and he left himself in no sort of<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
suspense or uncertainty as to how he
would deal with this one.</p>

<p>Whether right or wrong, whether
wise or foolish, in any sudden crisis
requiring sudden choice of action, he
obeyed his natural impulse, subject
to his own rough code of duty only,
without an instant's hesitation, and
followed it up with unswerving determination,
totally unembarrassed by any
anxiety as to where it might lead or
what it might cost him, or as to
any ultimate consequences that might
ensue.</p>

<p>In nine cases out of ten a man of
honour, placed as he was now, would
have regretted an unconsidered act of
folly, and have cast about for means
of extricating himself and the girl who
was behaving badly to her affianced<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
husband from the position into which
it had led them&mdash;even, perhaps, to
the extent of using</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some rough discourtesy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blunt or break her passion."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But he was the one man in ten who,
equally a man of honour, felt himself
under no obligation to do anything of
the kind. If she loved him&mdash;and now
he knew she did; if he loved her, or
was able to love her&mdash;and he allowed
himself no doubt upon that point
from this moment of her self-revelation,
though he had not <i>meant</i> to permit
anybody (least of all a mere child like
this) to supplant the dead woman on
whom the passion of his best years
had been spent&mdash;then the thing was
settled. They might waltz together till<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
daylight, and no one would have any
right to interfere.</p>

<p>The social complications that surrounded
them, and which a conventional
gentleman would have considered
of the last importance, were
to him mere matters of detail. They
must manage to get out of them as
best they could.</p>

<p>So he carried her round and round
the room, the most perfect partner
he had ever danced with, who moved
so sympathetically with all his movements
that she might have been his
shadow&mdash;but for the electric current
of strong life that her hand in his,
and her light weight on his shoulder,
and the subtle sense of her emotion,
sent thrilling through his veins; and
in the teeming silence his brain was<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
busy making rapid plans and calculations
for effectively dealing with the many
difficulties that would come crowding
upon both of them as soon as this
waltz was over.</p>

<p>Clearly, the first thing to do was
to dispose of ambiguities between
themselves.</p>

<p>"Come into the conservatory," he
said, in a quick under tone, when five
silent, delicious minutes had passed;
"I want to say something to you
before these people begin to spread
all over the place again."</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, as if a spell
had been broken, the light and rapture
died suddenly out of her face, her
limbs relaxed, her airy footsteps faltered,
she seemed to melt away in his
arms.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>"Oh," she whispered, looking up
at him with tragic eyes, full of fear
and despair, "how wicked I have been!
What <i>will</i> he say to me?"</p>

<p>"Never mind <i>him</i>," replied Mr.
Dalrymple; "you must not let him
have any right to dictate to you any
more&mdash;you must break off your engagement
at once, and get out of his
hands. Wicked!&mdash;the only wicked
thing would be to deceive him any
longer. You <i>know</i> you don't love him.
Come into the conservatory, and let us
talk about it. <i>Do</i> come&mdash;there is nobody
there now!"</p>

<p>But Rachel, being a woman, and a
coward, and only eighteen years old,
would not come. She knew what she
wanted, but she dared not do it&mdash;she
dared not even think of it.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>"I must not&mdash;I must not!" she
protested, in a childish panic of terror.
"Let me go, Mr. Dalrymple, <i>please</i>&mdash;I
have done very wrong&mdash;I am afraid
to stay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And slipping out of his arms, which
did the utmost that courtesy permitted
to hold her, she fled through a doorway
near and disappeared; and thus
threw away an opportunity the loss of
which was to cost them both long
days and nights of suspense and
suffering&mdash;as she foresaw with agonies
of regret, even while she did it.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalrymple danced and talked,
and sauntered about, proud and cool
as usual to the superficial observer,
but raging with impatience in his
heart, and watched for her return;
but he saw her no more until supper<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
time, when she was led into the
dining-room, looking very pale and
quiet, on Mr. Kingston's arm.</p>

<p>The whole night passed, and he
never had a chance to get near her
again; though as may be supposed, it
was from no lack of effort on his
part; and he went to the laundry at
last, hours after she had gone to bed,
to change his clothes preparatory to
taking a morning walk up the hills,
without even having had the satisfaction
of one look from her eyes,
which, however timid and terrified,
he felt sure would have told him the
truth.</p>

<p>She did not come into the drawing-room
before breakfast; and at that
irregularly conducted meal she sat
again by Mr. Kingston's side, the<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
whole table's length from him. But
glancing round her as she took her
seat, she met his fixed gaze, and
bowed with a subtle, wistful impressiveness
that reassured him completely
as to the state of her mind towards
him, let her outward actions be what
they might.</p>

<p>It was very tantalising; all his
habitual calmness was upset; his very
hand trembled as he took his coffee
from Lucilla, and once when his
gentle hostess spoke to him, he did
not hear her.</p>

<p>The fret of this state of things,
it is needless to say, chafed his
incipient passion into flame; and the
flame was kept up thereafter, at a
more or less fierce heat and brightness,
by the winds of adversity that<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
ought to&mdash;and in nine cases out of
ten would&mdash;have put it out.</p>

<p>After breakfast the company began
to disperse in a desultory manner
by installments. Some of the guests
lingered until the afternoon; some until
the next day.</p>

<p>The Digbys were the first to leave&mdash;partly
because they had so far to
go, partly because Mrs. Digby was
anxious about her children&mdash;and of
course Mr. Dalrymple had to go with
them.</p>

<p>He hunted in vain for Rachel when
the breakfast party broke up. She
<i>knew</i> he was hunting for her, and she
longed to go to him, and therefore
as a matter of course, she hid
herself.</p>

<p>Only at the last moment, as he<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
was about to ride gloomily away, she
appeared on the threshold of one of
the inferior front doors, pale and
shrinking, but desperate with vague
despair&mdash;thinking to solace herself with
one more glimpse of him when he
would not know she was looking.
But he saw her in a moment, flung
himself from Lucifer's back, and
caught her before she could steal away
again.</p>

<p>It was not the sort of farewell he
had hoped for&mdash;several of the ladies
came straggling about them before
they could exchange half a dozen words&mdash;but
it was infinitely better than
none.</p>

<p>"Are you going to Queensland?"
Rachel asked, in a tone which said plainly&mdash;"Are
you going away from me?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>"I must go," he replied; "but I
shall not stay&mdash;I shall come back as
quickly as possible. And you&mdash;what
will you do?"</p>

<p>She flushed scarlet and dropped her
eyes, and her lips began to quiver.
The rustle of Mrs. Hardy's majestic
skirts was heard approaching. It was
too late for confidences.</p>

<p>"I hope, when I come back, I shall
find you free," he whispered hurriedly,
emphasising the significance of the
words with the crushing clasp of his
hand over hers and the eager desire in
his eyes; and then he took off his cap,
included all the ladies in one last
silent adieu, remounted his horse, and
departed.</p>

<p>As he rode through the bush this
lovely spring morning, near enough to<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
the waggonette to open the gates for it,
but far enough away to indulge in his
meditations undisturbed, he pondered
many things; and particularly he
wondered, with a devouring anxiety,
what Rachel had been doing and thinking
of since she left him so abruptly
at midnight, after practically giving herself
to him.</p>

<p>If he could have known it is doubtful
if he would have felt so certain
of her as he was, though nothing would
have deterred him now from making
the best fight in his power for the
possession of her.</p>

<p>When, in terror of the consequences
of what she had done, she broke
away from him and escaped out of
the ball-room, she rushed to her own
room, forgetting until she dashed into<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
the middle of an untidy litter of open
boxes and portmanteaus which Miss
Hale had left on the floor, that it was
not hers to-night; and then she turned
and sped down one of the innumerable
passages into the quiet starlight outside,
and sought refuge in that lonely arbour
at the bottom of the garden, which
already, not many hours before, had
given sanctuary to these new emotions.</p>

<p>That she courted bronchitis and
consumption, exposing her bare warm
arms and bosom to the chill of a frosty
night, was a trivial circumstance quite
unworthy of consideration.</p>

<p>In this arbour she abandoned herself
to the full luxury of that passion
which was neither joy nor grief, and
yet had the pain and ecstasy of both
in the sharpest degree.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>She knelt on the damp floor,
and leaned her arms on the dusty
bench, regardless of panic-stricken
ants and enterprising black beetles,
and she shook from head to foot with
sobs.</p>

<p>"Oh my love!" she murmured to
herself. "Oh, my love!"</p>

<p>And then presently lifting herself up
and appealing to the star-worlds far
away, and the immutable universe in
general:</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do? Oh, what
can I do?"</p>

<p>By and bye she sat down on the
bench, clasped her hands on her
knees, and tried her best to compose
herself.</p>

<p>The keen air made her shiver,
and perhaps it did something to cool<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
her agitation and brace her nerves as
well.</p>

<p>Slowly she gathered her wits together,
made tremulous efforts to
school herself to be womanly and
courageous, and at last crept back
to the lighted and crowded house,
hugging a brave but terrible resolution.</p>

<p>She went to the nearest fire to
warm herself. It was in a little room
adjoining the dining-room, where the
last preparations for supper were going
on.</p>

<p>As she knelt on the hearthrug,
extending her white arms to the
blaze, Mr. Kingston came behind her
and laid his hands on her shoulders, so
silently and unexpectedly that she gave
a little startled cry.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>"Did I frighten you, my pet?"
said he, gaily; "I beg your pardon.
I couldn't think where you were
gone to. I am afraid you are tired.
You have been waltzing too much.
That fellow Dalrymple does go round
at a killing pace with his long legs.
Poor Miss Hale couldn't stand him
at all&mdash;she nearly fainted. Ah, naughty
child! Didn't I tell you not to dance
with him? And you never paid the
least heed! If this is how you defy
me now, what am I to expect after
we are married, eh?"</p>

<p>She looked up in his face with
guilty, bewildered eyes. He was not
by any means so cool as he assumed
to be, but it was evident that
he intended to ignore her offence,
and was not going to scold her.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p><i>He</i> was not young and rash, if
she was; and the few minutes he
had taken for reflection, during her
absence in the garden, had shown
him where the path of wisdom lay.
Her first sensation was one of extreme
relief; and then she became slowly
conscious of a vague sinking at her
heart.</p>

<p>Once more she sighed to herself&mdash;feeling
discouraged and overpowered,
and unequal to the formidable vastness
of her resolution&mdash;"Oh, what shall
I do?"</p>

<p>It would have been much better&mdash;much
easier&mdash;if he had scolded
her.</p>

<p>Before the revels of the night were
quite over, Mrs. Hardy sent her to
bed, noticing that she was looking<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
unusually quiet and pale. She was
very glad to go, and made haste to
hide herself in the little impromptu
nest that had been prepared for her
on a couch in her aunt's room, before
that lady should require the use of
her apartment.</p>

<p>She was wide awake, however, when
Mrs. Hardy joined her, and too restless
to disguise it; and the elder
woman, who knew nothing of the
girl's entanglements with her two
lovers&mdash;who had, indeed, congratulated
herself on the prudent abstinence
which had been unexpectedly practised
with reference to "that objectionable
young man" who was such a dangerously
delightful dancer&mdash;gossiped and
grumbled over the little events of the
evening, chiefly of the accident to her<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
lace and the absurdities of Miss Hale
and Mr. Lessel, who were publicly
known to have had a serious misunderstanding,
unaware of her listener's
pre-occupation, until the candles were
finally extinguished.</p>

<p>About an hour later, as she was
anxiously cogitating what steps she
should take towards the repairing of
her own mishap, Mrs. Hardy thought
she heard a suspicious sound in the
silence of the room.</p>

<p>"Rachel," she called, softly; "is
that you, child?"</p>

<p>No answer. Only a rustle of drapery,
indicating that Rachel had turned over
in her bed. She listened a few
minutes, and the suspicious sound
was repeated. Raising herself on her
elbow, she called more loudly.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>"You are not <i>crying</i>, Rachel, are
you?"</p>

<p>The girl flung herself out of bed,
ran across the room, a little white
ghost in the faint dawn, and threw
her arms round her aunt's neck. She
had no mother, poor little thing, to
tell her troubles to; and she wanted
a mother now.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Aunt Elizabeth," she
sobbed passionately, "do help me&mdash;I
am so miserable! I don't want to
marry Mr. Kingston! I don't love
him&mdash;I have made a mistake! I didn't
think enough about it, and now I
know we should never suit each
other. Won't you tell him I was too
young, and that I made a mistake?
Won't you&mdash;oh, please do!&mdash;help me
to break it off?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>On what a mere chance does destiny
depend.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Hardy's evening had been
triumphant and prosperous&mdash;if she had
not torn her best lace, and torn it in
consequence of Rachel's carelessness&mdash;she
would probably have received the
girl's touching confidence as a tender
mother should. As it was, she felt that
after all her fatigues and worries, this
was really too much.</p>

<p>"What nonsense are you talking,
child?" she exclaimed angrily. "Is it
any fault of Mr. Kingston's if Miss
Hale behaves like an idiot? She is
nothing but a vulgar flirt, and he
knows it as well as you do&mdash;only
it is his way to be attentive to all
women."</p>

<p>"Miss Hale!" repeated Rachel vaguely;<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
"I'm not thinking of Miss Hale.
I am not blaming anybody&mdash;only myself.
I was very wrong to accept Mr.
Kingston at the first&mdash;oh, aunt, you
<i>know</i> we are not suited to each other!
He ought to marry somebody older and
grander, and I&mdash;I thought I should
like to be rich, and to live in that
house&mdash;and I thought I should come to
love him in time; but now I know it
was all a mistake. Do&mdash;do let me
break it off before it goes any further!
Let me stay with you&mdash;I shall be <i>quite</i>
happy to stay with you and Uncle
Hardy, if you'll only let me!"</p>

<p>"You are dreaming," replied her
aunt, giving her a slight shake in the
extremity of her dismay and mortification;
"you talk like a baby. Do you
think a man is to be taken up one day<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
and thrown away the next? And it is
worse than that to jilt a man&mdash;and Mr.
Kingston of all people&mdash;after being
engaged to him for months, as you
have been, and after leading him into
all sorts of preparations and expense.
The bare idea is monstrous! And all
for nothing at all, but some ridiculous
sudden fancy! You may have seen
things of that sort done amongst the
people you have been brought up
with, but no <i>lady</i> would think of
disgracing herself and her family by
such conduct."</p>

<p>"Oh, aunt!" moaned Rachel piteously,
as if she had had an unexpected
blow.</p>

<p>"I don't like to speak harshly to
you, my dear," Mrs. Hardy proceeded,
in a rather more gentle, but still irritated<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
tone. "Only you <i>must</i> not vex
me with such absurd and childish
notions. I know it is only a passing
whim&mdash;you are over-tired, and you are
hurt because Mr. Kingston paid Miss
Hale so much attention, though it is
only what he does to all women, without
meaning anything whatever; but still
it is a serious and horrible thing&mdash;breaking
an engagement, a really happy
engagement, as yours is&mdash;jilting a kind,
good man, after giving him every
encouragement&mdash;even to <i>think</i> of! Don't
let me hear you mention it again,
unless you want to break my heart
altogether. And after all I have done
for you&mdash;I don't want to boast, but I
<i>have</i> been a good aunt to you, Rachel,
and you would have been in a poor
place but for me&mdash;the least you can do<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
is to respect my wishes, especially as
you know I wish nothing but what is
for your real good and welfare."</p>

<p>Rachel wandered back to her bed,
laid her head gently on the pillow, and
closed her eyes. Mrs. Hardy in the
dead silence that presently ensued, was
relieved to think that she had "settled
off" at last; but it was not sleep that
kept her so quiet&mdash;it was the calmness
of defeat and despair.</p>

<p class="h3">RACHEL'S FIRST VISIT IN MELBOURNE.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-i.jpg" alt="I"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">I</span>N the last week of August,
when the place was looking
its loveliest&mdash;the rustic gables
of the pretty house all hung with
wistaria, and the shrubberies full of
fragrant bushes of purple and white
lilac&mdash;Mrs. Hardy, Mr. Kingston, and
Rachel took their departure from Adelonga.
It was to one of them a truly
heart-breaking business.</p>

<p>Rachel stood on the verandah while<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
the horses were being put to, clasping
Lucilla and the baby alternately to her
heart, and wept without restraint, until
her eyes were swollen, and her delicate
colour resolved into unbecoming
red patches, and there was scarcely a
trace of her beauty and brightness
left.</p>

<p>No one but herself was at all able
to realise what this moment cost her.
She was not only leaving a place where
she had spent the happiest period of
her youth; not only parting from
friends with whom she had established
the most tender and sympathetic relations;
she was closing a chapter, or
rather a brief passage, which was the
one inspired poem of her life; and she
was saying good-bye to Hope.</p>

<p>As long as she was at Adelonga,<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
there was the chance that Mr. Dalrymple
might come back&mdash;at any rate, notwithstanding
the Queensland arrangements,
there was a constant impression that
he was near. And as long as she was
at Adelonga she had felt bold to strive,
by various feeble and ineffectual devices,
to extricate herself from her engagement.</p>

<p>Now she was going where it seemed
to her her lover would never be allowed
to reach her, and where in a hard
world of money and fashion, and under
the terrible dominion of "the house,"
she would be a helpless victim in the
hands of Fate.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, darling Lucilla!" she
sobbed; "thank you so much&mdash;I have
been so happy here&mdash;I am so sorry to
go away!"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>The gentle woman was inexpressibly
touched, and of course cried for company.
Mrs. Hardy had her own maternal
reluctance to face an indefinite term of
separation from her daughter. And
altogether Mr. Kingston was not without
justification for his unusually irritable
frame of mind.</p>

<p>He did not like to see women crying;
he was particularly annoyed that Rachel
should exercise so little command over
herself, and that she should have red
eyes and a swollen nose; and he was
uneasy about the untoward episode
which had been the first hitch in the
smooth current of his engagement, and
wondered whether it could be possible
that a lingering fancy for that Dalrymple
fellow was making her so unwilling to
return to her Melbourne life.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, he hated country travelling&mdash;long
drives over rough bush roads,
and bivouacs at country inns, where the
food was badly cooked and the wine
detestable; and he was suspicious about
the behaviour of the Adelonga horses,
whose little traits of character came
out rather strongly in the invigorating
air of spring; and he had a nasty
touch of gout.</p>

<p>However, the day was fine, and the
drive was lovely. As she was carried
along, with the soft air blowing in her
face, full of the delicious fragrance of
golden wattle, Rachel ceased to cry&mdash;becoming
calm, and pensive, and pretty
again&mdash;and took to meditation; wondering,
for the most part, what Queensland
was like, and how it was she
could ever have thought Melbourne, as<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
a place of residence, preferable to the
bush.</p>

<p>They passed a charming little farmhouse,
more picturesque in the simple
elegance of its slab walls and brown
bark roof than any Toorak villa of
them all, set in its little patch of
garden, with fields of young green corn
and potatoes, neatly fenced in, behind
it. It had its little rustic outbuildings,
its bright red cart in the shed,
its tidy strawyard, its cows and pigs
and poultry feeding in the bush close
by.</p>

<p>The farmer was working in his garden;
the farmer's wife, on her knees beside
him, was weeding and trimming the
borders of thyme that ringed the little
flower beds. They both paused to gaze
at the imposing equipage crashing<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
along with its four strong horses, and
at the ladies and gentlemen perched so
high above them; and Rachel, looking
down from her box-seat, thought she
had never seen such a picture of rural
and domestic peace. She had suddenly
ceased to regard material wealth and
splendour as in any way essential to
happiness.</p>

<p>To live in some such home as this
(provided one had enough to live on
and to pay one's way), working
with one's own hands for the man
one loved&mdash;that seemed to her at this
moment the ideal lot in life.</p>

<p>Having started from Adelonga an
hour before noon, the horses were taken
out at two o'clock to be fed and
watered, and the little party camped
beside a shady water-hole for lunch.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>Lucilla had put up a bounteous
basket of good things, and all the
materials for afternoon tea; and the
fun of arranging the grassy table first,
and of making a fire and boiling the
kettle afterwards&mdash;not to speak of the
very satisfactory meal that intervened&mdash;had
its natural effect upon our impressionable
heroine of eighteen.</p>

<p>Her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, much revived by a tumbler
of dry champagne, carefully cooled in
the water-hole, was also in improved
spirits and temper, and he set himself
to be very kind to his little
sweetheart, and forgave her all her misdeeds.</p>

<p>Between three and four, having had
their tea, the horses were put to, and
they started on their way again; and
just at nightfall they arrived at the<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
railway, and at the inn where they were
to spend the night.</p>

<p>Here they found dinner awaiting them,
of which Rachel partook in sleepy
silence; and she went to bed soon afterwards,
and slept too soundly even to
dream of trouble.</p>

<p>In the morning they parted from Mr.
Thornley, and started by the first train
to town; at noon they lunched in a
railway refreshment-room; and in the
middle of the afternoon they found themselves
once more in Toorak, being helped
out of the family brougham by good-natured
Ned, and welcomed into the
green satin drawing-room by his bright-faced
wife.</p>

<p>"And so you are back again at
last!" exclaimed Beatrice gaily, as she
took her young cousin into her arms.<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
"And how are you, dear child? Why
you look quite pale. Take off your hat
and sit down at once, and have some
tea. Mr. Kingston, I don't think this
country air that they talked so
much about has done anything very
wonderful after all. Rachel is not
looking so well as she was when she
left."</p>

<p>Rachel blushed a lovely rose-colour
immediately, of course, and Mr. Kingston
looked up at her with vague
anxiety.</p>

<p>"I don't think she is, myself," he
said; "I noticed it as soon as I got up
there. But she will be all right now she
is home again."</p>

<p>"I am only tired," murmured
Rachel.</p>

<p>"A girl like you has no business to<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
be tired," retorted the little woman
brusquely.</p>

<p>It did not escape her sharp eyes
that something was the matter, and
she determined to take the earliest
opportunity to find out what it
was.</p>

<p>"I do hope to goodness," she said
to herself, "that it is not her engagement
that she is tired of&mdash;and everything
going on so nicely!"</p>

<p>And then she took off Rachel's sealskin
cap and jacket, settled her by
the fireside, furnished her with a cup
of fragrant tea and some thin bread
and butter, and left her to herself
while she attended to her mother's
wants.</p>

<p>Beatrice and her tea had a generally
cheering and invigorating effect.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Kingston, making himself comfortable
in a very easy chair, grew
talkative and witty upon the news of
the day and the latest items of fashionable
gossip; in the society of this
charming little woman of the world&mdash;<i>his</i>
world&mdash;the satisfaction of being in town
again began to creep over him pleasantly.</p>

<p>He stayed for half an hour&mdash;outstaying
Ned, who retired modestly at
the end of twenty minutes; then
he led Rachel into the hall, kissed
her, told her to go to bed early
and come out with him for a ride
in the morning, and went off to
his club&mdash;sorry to leave his little
lady-love, but glad to be able to
get his letters, to hear what was
going on in Melbourne, and to read his<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
"Argus" on the day of publication
again.</p>

<p>After his departure Mrs. Hardy and
Beatrice plunged fathoms deep in talk.
Mrs. Hardy wanted to know how her
husband and her servants, and her
neighbours and her friends, had been
conducting themselves during her absence,
and Beatrice wanted minute particulars
about Lucilla and the baby.</p>

<p>Rachel had no occasion to feel herself
<i>de trop</i>; at the same time she
saw she was not wanted. She sauntered
softly round the room, laid some
music scattered about over the piano
in a neat pile, re-arranged some yellow
pansies that were tumbling out of a
green Vallauris bowl, and then stole
noiselessly into the hall and out of the
house.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>The grounds of the Hardy domain
were more beautiful with flowers
now than she had ever seen them;
but she did not stay amongst the
flowers. She went down little lonely
paths, intersecting vegetable beds
and forcing-frames, to a gate at
the bottom of the kitchen-garden,
where she was within speaking
distance of the workmen engaged
on the new house, with nothing
to impede a full view of their
operations.</p>

<p>She was feverishly anxious to know
how they were going on&mdash;whether they
were still "pottering at the foundations,"
or whether the stage of walls had set
in.</p>

<p>The working day was not yet over,
and the well-known chinking and clinking<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
of the stonemason's implements smote
her ear. She thought, when she began
to count them, that there were a great
many more men than there used
to be, and she wondered why this
was.</p>

<p>The young man who was sent out by
the architects to supervise the builders,
and whose acquaintance she had made
with Mr. Kingston, was walking about
the dusty enclosure, and presently
recognising her, he lifted his hat,
and then seeing that she still lingered,
came up to the gate to speak
to her.</p>

<p>"How are you getting on, Mr. Moore?"
she asked pleasantly. "Are you still
doing the foundations?"</p>

<p>Mr. Moore assured her that they
had completed the foundations, and<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
that they were getting on splendidly.</p>

<p>"Won't you come out and have
a look at what has been done?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>She thanked him and said she would;
and he opened the gate with alacrity,
and escorted her through a labyrinth
of bricks and stones, over ground
strewn thickly with sharp-edged chips
that cut holes in her boots, very well
pleased to be the first to show her
the progress that had been made in her
absence.</p>

<p>She could see for herself that a great
deal had been done. The trenches were
filled up; great square blocks of stone
ridged the outlines of the ground-floor
rooms&mdash;little bits of rooms they
looked, and not at all like the stately<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
and spacious apartments of the architect's
design; but it seemed to her that what
had been done could not be a tenth or
twentieth part of all that there was to
do.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, "it takes a
long time to build the walls and make
such a quantity of windows?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," responded Mr. Moore
cheerfully. "All the worst of the work
is over now, as far as the shell is
concerned; the walls will run up in
no time. It is a big house, but there
are plenty of men on it, and all
materials ready. It is after the shell
is done that the real tedious work commences."</p>

<p>"You mean after the roof is
on?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The interior decorations are<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
the chief thing about this house. The
outside is not much."</p>

<p>"When do you expect the shell will
be finished?" asked Rachel, in fear and
trembling.</p>

<p>"Some time in the course of the summer&mdash;within
the next two or three months
probably."</p>

<p>"And the roof on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; of course the roof on," he
replied.</p>

<p>There was a pause; and then she said
in a very small, thin voice:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Moore. I think I
must go back now."</p>

<p>He escorted her back to the garden
gate, lifted his hat, and bade her good
evening; and it struck him suddenly&mdash;with
far more force than it had
struck Beatrice&mdash;that she was looking<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
extremely unwell, and not at all like
the bright and blooming creature that
she was when she went away.</p>

<p class="h3">IN MRS. HARDY'S STORE-ROOM.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-r.jpg" alt="R"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">R</span>ACHEL was very young, no
doubt, but she was growing
rapidly. To all intents and
purposes she was at least five years
older when she came home from
Adelonga than she was when she went
there; and the process of development
by no means ceased or slackened at
that point.</p>

<p>The blossoming of her womanhood
had come suddenly, like the blossoming<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
of the almond trees, in one warm
burst of spring; but the inner heart,
that budded in secret, continued to swell
and ripen, in spite of&mdash;perhaps because
of&mdash;the absence of sunshine in her
spiritual life.</p>

<p>The physical change in her was noticeable
to everybody. Her constitution
was much too sound to be easily
injured by mental wear and tear; but
her health was necessarily affected in
a greater or less degree, temporarily,
for the better or for the worse, by
the more powerful of those mental
emotions to which her body was
peculiarly sensitive and responsive at all
times.</p>

<p>So she lost some of her delicate
pinky colour, and her large eyes grew
heavy and dreamy, and she looked<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
generally faded and altered, in the
dulness of these empty days. She had
no more enthusiasm for Toorak life
and Melbourne dissipations. She went
into no raptures over jewels and
dresses, or any pretty things; she had
none of the old zest for operas and
balls.</p>

<p>She was quiet, and silent, and preoccupied,
moving about the house with
a strange new dignity of manner
(resulting from the total absence of
self-consciousness), a sort of weary
tolerance, as if she had lived in it all
her life, and was tired of it.</p>

<p>After watching her for a few days,
secretly, and in much perplexed anxiety,
Mrs. Reade made up her mind that
something was seriously wrong, and
that it was time for her to interfere<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
to set it right. She went to her
mother in the first place for information.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock in the morning,
and Mrs. Hardy was in her store-room,
counting out the day's allowance of
eggs to an aggrieved and majestic
cook.</p>

<p>The little woman stood by silently,
watching the transaction with a smile
in her brilliant eyes, thinking to herself
what a great mistake it was, if
poor mamma could but see it, to insist
on an inflexible morality and economy
in these petty matters; and when it
was completed, after a little acrimonious
discussion, she quietly shut the door,
and addressed herself to her own business
in her customary straightforward
way.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>"I want to know what is the matter
with Rachel," she began, spreading
her handkerchief on a keg of vinegar,
and sitting down on it deliberately.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy mechanically sought repose
in the one chair of the apartment,
which stood in front of the little table
where she was in the habit of making
out her accounts.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that is more than I can
tell you, my dear. What an insolent
woman that is!&mdash;if she thinks I am
going to let her have the run of my
stores, as Mrs. Robinson did, she is very
much mistaken."</p>

<p>"Something is wrong with Rachel,"
proceeded Mrs. Reade calmly; "and I
want to find out what it is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy made an effort to smooth
her ruffled feathers down.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>"I think the child must be fretting
for Lucilla and the baby, Beatrice. She
and Lucilla were bosom friends, and she
just went wild about the baby&mdash;it
was quite ridiculous to see her with
it. And when she left them she cried
as if she were completely heartbroken;
and she has never been like herself
since. I can't think what else ails her&mdash;unless
she is out of sorts, and wants
some medicine. I did give her some
chamomilla yesterday, but it does not
seem to have done her any good."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Reade, with a sudden
smile, "I don't think it is a case for
chamomilla. She is not ill; she is unhappy&mdash;anyone
can see that. <i>You</i> can
see it, can't you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure no girl has less cause to
be unhappy," protested Mrs. Hardy<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
evasively, in a fretful and anxious tone.
"It is very ungrateful of her if she is."</p>

<p>"But what can have caused it? She
was all right when she went to Adelonga.
Something must have happened while
she was there. She is not merely
fretting after Lucilla and the baby&mdash;oh,
no, it is a deeper matter than
that. I am afraid&mdash;I really am seriously
afraid, by the look of things&mdash;that it
has something to do with Mr. Kingston."
Her mother, though silent, was so obtrusively
conscious and uneasy that she
felt assured, the moment that she looked
at her, of the correctness of her surmise.
"Oh, do tell me what has happened!"
she continued, eagerly. "Something has,
I know. It is what I have been
dreading all along&mdash;with these tiresome
delays! They ought to have been<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
married out of hand, and then there
would have been no trouble."</p>

<p>"If there <i>is</i> anything wrong between
them," Mrs. Hardy reluctantly admitted,
"it is&mdash;I must say that for Rachel,
though she is very trying with her
silly childishness&mdash;it is Mr. Kingston's
doings."</p>

<p>"Of course," assented Mrs. Reade,
promptly.</p>

<p>"It was on the night of the ball.
He rather neglected Rachel&mdash;the first
time I ever knew him to do it&mdash;and
he flirted in that foolish way of his&mdash;with
Minnie Hale. You know Minnie
Hale?&mdash;a great, fat, giggling creature&mdash;quite
a common, vulgar sort of girl&mdash;not
in the least <i>his</i> sort, one would
have imagined. I don't wonder that
Rachel was offended; I was extremely<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
vexed with him myself, for he did it so
openly&mdash;everybody noticed it. It was
so bad, really, that the man that horrid
girl was engaged to, Mr. Lessel, broke
off with her on account of it. That
will show you. She was a great deal
worse than he was, of course. But he
went great lengths. Perhaps he had
been taking too much wine," she sighed,
plaintively.</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Reade. "He has
plenty of faults, but <i>that</i> is not one of
them."</p>

<p>"Rachel was deeply hurt and shocked,"
Mrs. Hardy proceeded. "Naturally, for
it was not a thing she had been used
to, poor child. She took it very much
to heart&mdash;so much that she wanted,
like Mr. Lessel, to break off her engagement
there and then." Here Mrs. Hardy<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
went into details of poor Rachel's unsuccessful
struggle for deliverance. "But
of course I reasoned with the foolish
child," she added conclusively; "I talked
her out of <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade sat very still, tracing
patterns on the floor with the point of
her parasol.</p>

<p>"And did they have a quarrel?" she
asked, vaguely. She was evidently thinking
of something else.</p>

<p>"No. There was a coolness, of course,
but&mdash;oh, no, I am sure they did not
quarrel. He has seemed anxious to
make up for it, and she has not shown
any temper or resentment. But things
have been uncomfortable if you can
understand&mdash;very unsatisfactory and
uncomfortable&mdash;ever since. I think she
was disappointed in him, and cannot<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
get over it. I have been hoping that
it was all right, and that she was
only unsettled and dispirited about
leaving Adelonga. But now you mention
it&mdash;yes, now I think of it&mdash;I'm
afraid she is brooding over that other
trouble still. Foolish child! she lives
in a world of romantic ideals, I suppose."</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> did Mr. Kingston flirt with
Minnie Hale?" asked Mrs. Reade,
looking up at her mother impressively.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, you know him as
well as I do."</p>

<p>"You think he was worn out with
being good?"</p>

<p>"He <i>has</i> been good, Beatrice&mdash;very
good&mdash;ever since his engagement."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, he has. But if he had had
a mind to misbehave, I don't think
his duty to Rachel would have stopped
him. The fact is, since his engagement
he has never wanted anyone
but her. I have watched him closely,
and wonderful as it seems, he has
never shown the slightest disposition
to flirt beyond the stage of pretty
speeches&mdash;not even when she was
away&mdash;not even with Sarah Brownlow."</p>

<p>"It is a great pity," sighed Mrs.
Hardy. "I wish they were safely
married."</p>

<p>"And at the worst of times," the
younger lady proceeded thoughtfully,
regardless of the interjection, "he
was fastidious in his choice&mdash;he liked
someone who was either pretty or<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
clever, or decidedly attractive in some
way. I never knew him take any
notice of a girl of <i>that</i> sort before."</p>

<p>"There is no accounting for men's
tastes, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Mrs. Reade replied
promptly; "I know that Minnie Hale
is not <i>his</i> taste. I know he did not
go on with her as you say he did,
merely for the pleasure of it to himself.
I think it must have been to
spite Rachel."</p>

<p>"Beatrice!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother&mdash;that is what I think.
It is the only reasonable motive he
could have had."</p>

<p>"But why on earth should he wish
to spite Rachel?"</p>

<p>"That is what I want you to tell<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
me. You were in the house with
them&mdash;try and think of all that happened
just before the ball. I'm
certain something was wrong between
them, to begin with. Perhaps you did
not notice it at the time, but you
might remember little circumstances&mdash;"
Mrs. Reade broke off, and watched
her mother's disturbed face with
bright attentiveness. "<i>Rachel</i> did not
flirt with anybody, did she?"</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, you know the
child is incapable of such a thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean deliberately, of
course. But she might do it accidentally,
with those sentimental eyes
of hers. And she <i>is</i> so charmingly
pretty!"</p>

<p>"No, she certainly did not flirt,"
said Mrs. Hardy; "she has never<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
given him any uneasiness on that
score, pretty as she is, and never
will, I am quite sure. But there was
a man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Mrs. Reade, laying
her parasol across her knees, and folding
her hands resignedly.</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'ah,' Beatrice,
before you hear what I am going to
tell you? There was a man there
whom Mr. Kingston disliked very
much. He gave himself airs, and they
somehow came into collision, and Mr.
Kingston was in rather a bad temper.
That was all that went wrong before
the ball, and Rachel had nothing to
do with that."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? I am certain
she had," the young lady replied
deliberately.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>"Well, if you think you know better
than I do, who was there to
see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on, dear mamma. Tell me all
about him. Who was he? What was
he like?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy, pocketing her dignity,
proceeded to describe Mr. Dalrymple,
with great amplitude of detail, as
he had appeared from her point of
view.</p>

<p>The result was a kind of superior
Newgate villian, of good birth and
distinguished presence, whom Mrs.
Reade regarded with a sinking
heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" she sighed, blankly,
"what a pity! What a grevious
pity!"</p>

<p>"I <i>can't</i> see why you should look<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
at it in this way, Beatrice. I tell
you she had little or nothing to say
to him, and she only danced with
him once the whole evening. I took
care to point out to her the kind of
man he was, and to warn her against
him."</p>

<p>"You ought not to have done
that."</p>

<p>"My dear, you will allow me to be
the best judge of what I ought to
do. She was very good and obedient,
and she acted in every way as I
wished her."</p>

<p>"But she liked him, didn't she?"
asked Mrs. Reade.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Hardy admitted, with
evident reluctance, "I am afraid she
did like him."</p>

<p>"I am sure she did," said Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
Reade, decisively. "And there is more
than liking in the matter, unless I
am much mistaken. I have never
been in love myself," she remarked
frankly, "but I fancy I know the
symptoms when I see them. I feared
from the first that it was something
of that sort that was the matter with
her. At any rate&mdash;" putting up her
hand to stay the imminent protest on
her mother's lips&mdash;"at any rate, if
he has not made her love him, he
has made her discontented with Mr.
Kingston."</p>

<p>"Well, Beatrice," the elder woman
exclaimed, with an impatient sigh,
rising from her chair, "if such a
thing should be&mdash;if such a misfortune
should have happened after all my
care&mdash;we must only do the best<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
we can to mend it. Thank goodness
he's gone. He is not at all likely
to give her another thought. If he
does&mdash;" Mrs. Hardy shut her mouth
significantly, and her Roman nostrils
dilated.</p>

<p>"You can't help his thinking what
he likes," said Mrs. Reade, with a
gleam of mockery in her bright
eyes.</p>

<p>"I can help his doing anything
further to disturb her. I can see
that he never meets or speaks to her
again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade continued to smile, looking
at her majestic mother with her
bird-like head on one side.</p>

<p>"I hope so," she said. "I'm sure
I hope so, if you can do it without
her knowledge. But if you should<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
have to act, whatever you do, don't
make martyrs of them."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," retorted Mrs.
Hardy.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-m.jpg" alt="M"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">M</span>RS. READE, being satisfied
that she had found out
Rachel's complaint&mdash;as indeed
she had&mdash;put her under treatment
without delay.</p>

<p>On the very day of her interview
with her mother in the store-room,
she sought and obtained permission to
take the patient home with her for a
week's visit, in order to try the experiment
of change and a new set of<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
dissipations, and to make her preliminary
investigations undisturbed.</p>

<p>She had a charming house of her
own at South Yarra, which she "kept"
admirably, and where, in an unpretensious
manner, she had established a
little <i>salon</i> that was a fashionable head
centre in Melbourne society, and well
deserved by virtue of its own legitimate
merits to be so.</p>

<p>She was not severely orthodox in
these matters, like Mrs. Hardy, who
weighted her entertainments with any
number of dull people, if they only
happened to be in the right set; though
she was quite ready to acknowledge
the propriety of her mother's system in
her mother's circumstances.</p>

<p>There was no want of refinement in
her hospitality, but there was a delicate<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
flavour of Bohemianism that, like the
garlic rubbed on the salad bowl, was
the piquant element that made it
delightful&mdash;to those, at any rate, who
were sufficiently intelligent to appreciate
it.</p>

<p>If men and women were uninteresting,
she could have nothing to do with
them, though they were the very "best
people;" that is to say, she limited her
intercourse to those ceremonial observances
which rigid etiquette demanded.</p>

<p>If they were clever and cultured, and
otherwise respectable and well-behaved,
and were capable of being fused harmoniously
into the general brightness
of her little circle, she was inclined to
condone a multitude of sins in the
matter of birth and station.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>Artists of all sorts, travellers and
politicians, distinguished members of
every profession (so long as their own
merits and accomplishments distinguished
them) were welcome at her house;
where they would be sure to meet the
most interesting women that a judicious
woman, superior to the petty
weakness of her sex, could gather together.</p>

<p>So it was that Mrs. Edward Reade's
afternoons and evenings were synonymous
with all that was intellectually
refreshing and socially delightful to
those who were privileged to enjoy
them.</p>

<p>But so it was, also, that Rachel, in
consideration of her youth, her impressionable
nature, and what were supposed
to be her democratic tendencies, had<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
not been allowed to know much about
them hitherto.</p>

<p>"Now, however, the case is different,"
said Beatrice, authoritatively, as she
sat in her little pony carriage at the
front door, waiting for her cousin to
come down stairs. "It will do her
good to shake up her ideas a little,
and draw her out of herself. And if
she does take an undue interest in
people of the lower orders"&mdash;looking
at her mother with mocking bright eyes&mdash;"it
will be so much the better.
Perhaps Signor Scampadini, with that
lovely tenor of his&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Beatrice. Mr. Kingston
would very much dislike anything of
that sort."</p>

<p>"Anything of what sort?" laughed
Mrs. Reade. "Mr. Kingston can trust<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
me, mamma. And we must counteract
Mr. Dalrymple somehow."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kingston himself ought to
counteract him&mdash;if there is any counteracting
necessary."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Mrs. Reade, shaking
her head slightly. She said no more,
but in her own mind she put that
argument aside as useless.</p>

<p>There had been a time, indeed, when
she had believed Mr. Kingston sufficient
for all purposes, on the basis of
Rachel's apparently modest spiritual
needs; but now she knew she had been
mistaken.</p>

<p>The girl had grown and changed
since then, and the old conditions no
longer fitted her. The little woman was
disappointed, but she was too wise to
make a fuss about it. Difficulties had<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
come that she ought to have foreseen
and provided for, but since they had
come, they must be dealt with. "Ah!"
she said, with a sigh and a smile; and
that was the extent of her lamentation.</p>

<p>So Rachel went away with her to
South Yarra, and had a brilliant week
of it. The weather was warm and
lovely, and the soft air full of the
delicate intoxication of spring time, to
which she was peculiarly susceptible.</p>

<p>She basked in sunshine as she rattled
about Melbourne streets and suburbs in
Beatrice's little basket-carriage, and as
she sat in Beatrice's bow-windowed
drawing-room, gossiping over afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>She had a month's allowance of society
dissipation of the most seductive description<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
in that week&mdash;music, dancing,
<i>tableaux vivants</i>, dressing, shopping,
sightseeing, swarms of gay and witty
company from noon till midnight, every
conceivable kind attention from her
cousin, and the most flattering homage
from everybody else&mdash;all in an easy and
cosy way that was very charming and
luxurious. It certainly cheered her up
a great deal.</p>

<p>We <i>do</i> get cheered, against our intention
and desire, against our belief
almost, by these little amenities that
appeal to our superficial tastes, even
when we seem to ourselves to be full of
trouble.</p>

<p>It is well for us that we are so
susceptible to light impressions, to the
subtle influences of the daily commonplace,
which are like delicate touches to<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
a crude picture in their effect upon our
lives; if we were not, our lives would
hardly be worth having sometimes,
crippled as they are with great sudden
griefs and disappointments, and wasted
with the lingering paralysis of spiritual
loss and want.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade, watching the effect of
her prescription day by day, thought
things were going on very nicely, and
took great credit to herself. She could
plainly perceive that the disturbing
element in the family arrangements was
no trifling ball-room fancy; but she had
great faith in the girl's youth and
gentle character, and in the efficacy of
judicious treatment, and it seemed to
her that her faith had not been misplaced.</p>

<p>At any rate, she justified her reputation<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
as a clever woman by the tact she
displayed in the management of her
self-imposed task. No one could have
done more, under the circumstances, to
further the desired end. She did not
have Mr. Kingston about her house
too much; she thought Rachel would
appreciate him more if she had time to
miss him a little. Nor did she force
the girl's confidence with respect to
Mr. Dalrymple, or even invite it in any
way&mdash;that is to say, not in any way
that was apparent to <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>She took no notice of the obvious
indications of her cousin's anxiety to
extricate herself from her engagement,
though secretly they caused her acute
uneasiness. She was a kind little soul,
and though quite content with a <i>mariage
de convenance</i> herself, did not like to<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
see another woman driven into it against
her will.</p>

<p>It was for Rachel's good that she
should be tided over those temptations
to squander a substantial future for a
romantic present, which were peculiarly
dangerous to a girl so undisciplined in
worldly wisdom as she, and it was absolutely
necessary to guard her against
the machinations of profligate spendthrifts;
but if she <i>could</i> have fallen in
with the excellent arrangements that
had been made for her, without repugnance
and suffering, what great cause
for thankfulness there would have been!</p>

<p>So, although she never wavered in
her determination to do what she considered
her duty, she did it, not only
with judgment, but with the utmost
gentleness and consideration.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>She took Rachel to call on certain
shabby and faded women who had made
rash marriages with poor or unsteady
men, that she might see the consequences
of such imprudence in the
sordid tastelessness of their dress and
their household furniture.</p>

<p>She likewise presented to her notice
the charming spectacle of a young bride
of fashion, as she "received" on her
return from her honeymoon, surrounded
by all the refinements of wealth
and culture in a perfectly-appointed
home.</p>

<p>She spoke incidentally, but often, of
the habits and customs of fast young
men, in general and in particular,
drawing picturesque illustrations from
her own experience, which tended to
show that they invariably made love to<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
every girl they came across, and forgot
all about her the moment her back was
turned. She showed her poetic photographs
of foreign cities; she taught
her the value of old lace and china.</p>

<p>And by these and other insidious
devices, she really contrived to do something
towards weakening the impression
that Mr. Dalrymple had made, and
strengthening the antagonistic cause.</p>

<p>But when the week was over, and she
took her young charge back to her
mother, intending to apply for an extension
of leave, that she might pursue
the treatment that had proved so
beneficial, alas! all her patient work
was undone in a moment, like the
web of the Lady of Shalott, when she
left off spinning to look at the irresistible
Sir Lancelot riding by.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>They arrived at the Toorak house
rather late in the afternoon, after a
visit to the Public Library to see the
last new picture, and one or two entertaining
calls; and they were told
that Mrs. Hardy was out, but was
expected in every minute.</p>

<p>Rachel jumped down from the carriage
first, and ran lightly up the
white steps into the hall, with a pleasant
greeting to the servant who admitted
her; and there she stood a few seconds,
to look round upon all the familiar appointments,
as people do when they return
home after an absence.</p>

<p>And as she looked, her eye fell upon
a card on the hall table, which she
immediately picked up.</p>

<p>"John," she called sharply, wheeling
round upon him with a sudden fierceness<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
of excitement that Mrs. Reade, a
dozen yards off, understood to mean
disaster of some sort; "John, when did
this gentleman call?"</p>

<p>"About half an hour ago, miss."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>John</i>&mdash;only half an hour!"</p>

<p>"He said he would call again to-morrow,
miss."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade came softly into the hall,
carelessly adjusting her long train behind
her.</p>

<p>"Who is it, dear?" she asked.
But she had already guessed who
it was.</p>

<p>Rachel held out the little slip of
pasteboard with an unsteady, shrinking
hand. She could not speak. There was
a great light and flush of excitement
in her face, which yet was as full of
fear as joy.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>"Roden Dalrymple," murmured Beatrice,
reading hesitatingly, as if the name were
unfamiliar to her. "Is not that one of
Lucilla's friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rachel, drawing a long
breath and speaking softly. "He was
at Adelonga when we were there. He
went away to Queensland, but&mdash;he has
come back."</p>

<p>"Evidently he has. What a pity we
missed him. He may have brought us
some news from Adelonga. Oh, dear me,
don't you want your tea very badly? I do.
John go and get us some tea, will you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade did not intend to commit
herself to any course of action until she
had time to think over this new and
most embarrassing complication, so she
dismissed Mr. Dalrymple from the
conversation.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>Rachel turned the card about in her
hands, reading its inscription over and
over again. She was going to carry it
away; but she reluctantly went back
and laid it where she had found it.
Then she followed Beatrice into the
drawing-room like one in a dream.</p>

<p>The little woman watched her closely
from the corner of her bright eyes, and
she was terribly alarmed. She had had
no idea until now what a formidable
person this Roden Dalrymple was. The
girl was in a quiver of excitement from
head to foot. She wandered restlessly
about the room, vaguely fiddling at the
furniture and ornaments; she could not
control her agitation.</p>

<p>John brought in the teapot, and Mrs.
Reade peeled her gloves from her small
white hands, and rolling them into a<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
soft ball, tossed them down amongst
the cups and saucers. She began to
pour out the tea in silence, wondering
what in the world she had better
do.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by the sound
of carriage wheels crunching up the
drive. Rachel came to a standstill in
the middle of the room, and listened
with a rigid intensity of expectation that
was quite as painful to her companion
as her more demonstrative emotion had
been.</p>

<p>They heard the bustle of Mrs. Hardy's
arrival, heard John open the front door,
heard the sweep of silken draperies in
the hall. And then they heard a familiar
voice, raised several notes above its
ordinary pitch.</p>

<p>"John!"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"When did this gentleman call?"</p>

<p>"About an hour after you left'm."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him we were all
out?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. And he'll call again to-morrow,
he says."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed&mdash;will he! You'll just
tell him, <i>whenever</i> he calls, that I am
not at home, John&mdash;that <i>nobody</i> is at
home. Do you hear? That gentleman
is not to be admitted."</p>

<p>"Oh, you stupid woman!" Mrs. Reade
sighed to herself, not meaning to be
disrespectful, but grudging to see delicate
work marred by inartistic hands.</p>

<p>And then she looked at Rachel, and
realised the catastrophe that had occurred.
All the colour had gone out
of the sensitive face, all its agitation,<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
all the soft, submissive tenderness that
had characterised it hitherto. She looked
straight before her, with stern eyes full
of indignant passion, and with her lips
set in a hard, thin line.</p>

<p>The meek little child, who had been
so easy to manage, was going to assert
the rights of womanhood, and to take
the conduct of her affairs into her own
hands.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-m.jpg" alt="M"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">M</span>R. DALRYMPLE was in Melbourne
for almost the whole
of the time that he had
intended to spare from his partner
and his property in Queensland, which
was nearly three weeks, and he never
once succeeded in communicating with
Rachel, which was the special mission
on which he had come down.</p>

<p>He called at the Toorak house
again and again, and was always<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
told that the ladies were not at
home.</p>

<p>There was not much else that he
could do at this stage of courtship,
knowing nothing of Rachel's circumstances
in connection with Mr. Kingston,
and having had no definite
assurances of her disposition towards
himself; but he did this persistently,
until he became suddenly aware that
Mrs. Hardy did not mean to admit
him.</p>

<p>Then he wrote a short note to
Mr. Gordon, containing certain instructions
in the way of business,
and an intimation that he might have
to stay in town longer than he
had anticipated, and, therefore, was
not to be calculated upon at
present.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>Having despatched which, he addressed
himself to the matter he
had in hand, with a quiet determination
to carry it through, sooner or
later, by some means.</p>

<p>It was not his way to plot and
scheme clandestinely, but being driven
to do it, he did it promptly and with
vigour.</p>

<p>He wrote a long letter to Rachel,
reviewing with delicate significance
the position in which they had stood
to one another on the day of their
parting at Adelonga, and formally
offering himself for her acceptance;
and he begged her to appoint some
time and place where, if she were
willing, she could give herself and
him an opportunity for coming to a
mutual understanding.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>This letter he did not put into the
post, being naturally distrustful of
Mrs. Hardy, but he carried it in
his pocket ready for any chance
that might enable him to deliver
it with his own hands&mdash;for which
chance he began to search with
diligence in every place of public
resort where Rachel would be likely
to appear.</p>

<p>Rachel, in the meantime, was
distracted with suspense and misery.
She saw all possibilities of a legitimate
meeting relentlessly and effectually
circumvented.</p>

<p>She was kept under such strict
surveillance that she did not even
see her lover's face, except on one
occasion, when she was at the opera,
and when, sitting between her aunt<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
and Mr. Kingston, she was afraid
to lift her eyes to look at
him.</p>

<p>She could do nothing in her own
behalf, while she was uncertain of
his intentions. She felt herself more
and more hopelessly in the toils of
her engagement, as day by day, Mr.
Kingston&mdash;who yet had mysteriously
changed somehow&mdash;became more and
more obtuse to the state of her
mind towards him, and more and
more persistently affectionate and
amiable, and as day by day, Mrs.
Hardy, grown hard and unsympathetic,
impressed more and more
strongly upon her the fact that she
was a penniless and friendless orphan
who owed everything that she had to
her.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>And all the time she loathed the
very sound of Mr. Kingston's voice
and the very touch of his hand, with
an unreasoning passion of repugnance
that she had never thought it possible
she could feel for one who had
been so kind to her; and as a
natural consequence&mdash;or cause&mdash;she
was consumed with a sleepless fever
of expectation and longing for that
other lover whom she loved.</p>

<p>But such a state of things could
not last, and after all it came to
an end much sooner than either of
them expected.</p>

<p>There came a night when Mr. and
Mrs. Hardy had to go to a stately
dinner party which did not include
young girls. A most lovely night it
was, in perhaps the loveliest month<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
of the year, when there was no
need to put candles in the carriage
lamps, and no need for a fire in the
big green drawing-room, where between
seven and eight o'clock Rachel was
left to amuse herself, in apparent
safety, until bed time. A young moon
shone in at the open windows before
the mellow daylight was gone, as
Mrs. Hardy, in rustling silk and
tinkling jewels, entered to say
good-night.</p>

<p>The evening wind went whispering
round the house, ruffling a thousand
tufts of bougainvillea that embossed
the outer wall, and breathing into
the dim room the sweetness of early
roses and the fresh fragrance of the
sea.</p>

<p>To Rachel, ever afterwards, it was<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
the most beautiful night that the
world had known.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, John will light
the gas for you&mdash;two burners will do
to-night, John&mdash;and you can practise
your music undisturbed. Don't leave
the windows open any longer; it will
be chilly by and bye. And don't sit
up late. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, auntie," responded
Rachel.</p>

<p>She proffered the regulation kiss
in an absent manner, nodded with a
smile to her uncle, who was waiting
outside, and stood on the threshold
of a French window to watch the
carriage until it passed out of the
gates and disappeared.</p>

<p>Then instead of going to practise
her music, she went out and sat<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
down on the top of one of the
square pedestals that flanked the
steps of the terrace upon which the
window opened, and clasped her hands
about her knees.</p>

<p>John left the window open for
her, lit the gas and the piano
candles, returned to find her still
sitting in the same place, as if she
had not stirred, and went away to
make his own arrangements for a
pleasant evening.</p>

<p>Half an hour later she was wandering
about the garden, heedless of the
chill that was creeping on with
nightfall, and looking before her with
eyes so full of dreams that they did
not see where she was going to&mdash;gliding
up and down the level
terraces like a ghost in the dusky<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
twilight, with the silver of the moonshine
on her golden hair.</p>

<p>And then, by mere mechanical
submission to the force of habit,
she found herself presently at that
back gate which overlooked "the
house," leaning her arms upon the
upper rail, and staring at the low
ridges of gleaming wall a few dozen
yards off, which were rising as it
seemed to her, with the rapidity of
magic from the foundations that had
taken so long to do, the stony embodiment
of a relentless fate.</p>

<p>It was very quiet there to-night.
No swarms of carpenters, and bricklayers,
and stonemasons; no idle boys
gaping at them over the fence; no
people walking and driving about the
road.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>She tried the gate, and found it
locked; then she climbed lightly over
it, and holding up her skirts, stole
across the strip of arid waste that lay
between it and the nucleus of the
building which was once to have been
her palace, and now could only be
her prison-house, eager to discover
anything she could that would indicate
the real progress that was being
made.</p>

<p>She threaded her course daintily
through heaps of brick and stone and
broken <i>d&eacute;bris</i>; she entered the skeleton
house by its gaping porch, and she
wandered about the labyrinth of its
passages and vestibules, feeling her
way with cautious feet and outstretched
hands, until she came to her own
boudoir; and there she sat down on<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
a joist of the flooring, and laid her
face on her knees and cried.</p>

<p>The sweetness of the solitary night,
quite as much as the sight of all those
permanently-adjusted ground-floor door
and window frames, melted her into
these sudden tears, full as she was of
the aching rapture of her love and
trouble, which needed but a touch to
overflow. The possibility of a human
spectator of her emotion never for a
moment occurred to her.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Roden Dalrymple had
also taken it into his head to have an
after-dinner walk in the moonlight, and
happening for a very good reason, to
be prowling about in this neighbourhood,
he had seen the slender little figure
gliding across the open space between
the back gate and the new building,<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
and he had guessed in a moment whose
it was.</p>

<p>And so, as Rachel sat with her feet
in subterranean darkness, her hands
clasping her knees just above the level
of the floor that was to be, and her
face hidden in her lap, she heard a
sound, suggestive of midnight robbers
and murderers, that for a moment
paralysed her timid heart; and then a
voice, calling her softly,</p>

<p>"Miss Fetherstonhaugh! Do not be
frightened. It is only I&mdash;Roden Dalrymple."</p>

<p>He came in through the gap of the
doorway, while she stared at him and
held her breath; he stepped swiftly
and lightly from joist to joist until
he reached the corner where she was
sitting.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[164]</span></p>

<p>Then he sat down beside her quietly,
as if he were taking a place she had
been keeping for him; and the next
moment&mdash;with no question asked and
no explanation given&mdash;they were sealing
the most sacred of all contracts irrevocably,
in the silence of the solemn
night.</p>

<p>It was well for Rachel that, with all
his faults, Roden Dalrymple was not
the reprobate he was supposed to be,
but a man of stainless honour, in
whose keeping the welfare of an
ignorant and imprudent girl was safe;
for&mdash;from the day when she went into
the conservatory with him in the first
hours of their acquaintance, stranger as
he was, and she the most modest of
girls, simply because he asked her&mdash;she
had laid herself, metaphorically, at his<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
feet&mdash;too simple and single in all her
aims and impulses not to love unreservedly
when she began to love at
all, too strong in her young enthusiasm
for her own ideals to be hampered by
doubts either of herself or him, too
thoroughly natural and ingenuous to
disguise her heart or to bend it to
the yoke of conventional law and
order.</p>

<p>Now she gave herself up at once,
turning to meet his outstretched arms,
lifting her face to his strong and eager
kisses with a passionate responsiveness
and abandonment that, while it infinitely
quickened his love and gratitude, showed
him plainly that all the responsibility of
her future happiness would rest with him.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, with a long sighing
sob, "I have wanted you so!"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>"Have you, indeed?" he replied,
tightening his arms about her with a
gesture that was more significant
than speech. "My little love, you shall
never want me any more, if I can help
it."</p>

<p>These were the terms of their "initial
marriage ceremony."</p>

<p>And it is just to Mr. Dalrymple to
say that he not only never took the
slightest advantage of the irregularities
that she innocently allowed, but&mdash;at
any rate, not until long afterwards&mdash;he
never even saw them.</p>

<p>That they were candid and truthful
in themselves and to one another was
from the first the essential bond
between them, otherwise unlike as they
were; and to him the absence of the
usual maidenly reticence and reluctance<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
displayed on these occasions indicated,
all circumstances considered, rather a
finer delicacy of nature than the ordinary,
and never the faintest suspicion
that she held the treasures of love
and womanhood cheaply, even for his
sake.</p>

<p>Feeling no need of further explanation&mdash;understanding
one another, by
that subtle sense which defies analysis,
that instinctive recognition of spiritual
kinship which, in its early development,
was to them what is called
"love at first sight," but which had
in it the germs of a true companionship
and comradeship that might defy
all the accidents of time and chance&mdash;they
sat for a few blessed silent
moments side by side, she with her
young head leaning trustfully against<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
his worn brown face, not wanting to
speak, unwilling even to think of all
the difficulties that lay in ambush
around them, ready to break into this
ineffable peace with the breaking of the
silence; looking over a low window-sill
before them into the quiet night,
with grave and happy eyes&mdash;at Melbourne,
lying in a glorified haze of
twilight beneath them, and at the silver
of the sea beyond.</p>

  <span class="hide">R</span>ACHEL," said Mr. Dalrymple
presently, speaking her name
as if he had had it in
familiar use for years, "I suppose you
have broken off with <i>him?</i>"</p>

<p>Rachel did not reply for a few
seconds; he felt her trembling in his
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me," she whispered,
turning her face a hair's-breadth nearer
to his as he stooped to listen.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>And then she told him all the story
of her engagement, as far as her new
experiences enabled her to read it, and
all the circumstances which had combined
to keep her still in captivity
so long after she should have been
free.</p>

<p>The simple narrative gave even him,
who was rather inclined to make molehills
of mountains, a sense of the
difficulties of the situation, that kept
him silent for a few minutes in unwonted
perplexity of mind.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" he asked abruptly,
at last.</p>

<p>"I shall be nineteen in three weeks,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"You are sure you won't be twenty-one?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I shan't. Why?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>"Because if you are only nineteen,
I cannot carry you off and marry you,
love, which would have been the simplest
way out of it."</p>

<p>"I should not like that way," whispered
Rachel. "It would be a wrong
way."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&mdash;except as a last resource.
Of course we would try all the other
ways first. But we must have our
rights, you know. If they won't give
them, we must take them&mdash;we must get
them as we can."</p>

<p>"Cannot we be married until I am
twenty-one?" she queried timidly.</p>

<p>"Not without your guardian's consent.
Is there any chance of my getting that,
or any kind of toleration even, if I call
on him at his office to-morrow and
use all the eloquence at my command?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>"No. Aunt Elizabeth won't let <i>him</i>
have anything to do with it."</p>

<p>"If I call on her, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;not the slightest. In the
first place, she won't see you. And
if she did&mdash;oh, no, you must not try&mdash;not
yet! I think it would make
everything worse than it is already."</p>

<p>"Then you see the alternative?&mdash;a
separation for perhaps two whole
years."</p>

<p>"If I know we are going to be so
happy at the end of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;at the end of it! It will be a
fine test for you, Rachel."</p>

<p>"Why for me, any more than for
you? Oh, don't talk of tests!" she
pleaded; "I only want to feel sure
I shall never lose you, and I<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
don't mind waiting two years. If
only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If only what?"</p>

<p>"If only Mr. Kingston would go
away!"</p>

<p>"Now listen to me," he said gently,
but with his grave peremptoriness, "you
must not let another day pass without
breaking off with him. You
must <i>send</i> him away, Rachel. I am
sorry for him, poor devil, but you
couldn't do him a worse wrong than
let him go on deceiving himself about
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think I would do that?
Of course I will not. I can do it <i>now</i>&mdash;now
that you have come. For now
I shall feel strong, and now I can tell
them why. I shall write him a letter
before I go to bed, and I shall tell<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
Aunt Elizabeth as soon as I have sent
it. But what will they say to me? It
will be dreadful."</p>

<p>"Poor little woman! Can't I take the
dreadful part of it for you? <i>I</i> shan't
mind it."</p>

<p>"You can't. I know it will be better
for us both if you will not have anything
to do with it just yet."</p>

<p>"I think I <i>must</i> see your uncle, dear,
before I go away again."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if you think it best. But it
will do no good with Aunt Elizabeth. He
leaves it all to her."</p>

<p>Mr. Dalrymple gazed thoughtfully at
the distant horizon, where little points
of yellow twinkled in the silvery obscurity
of the moonshiny bay.</p>

<p>He was deeply troubled and perplexed
about this tender little creature, and<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
the idea of leaving her to bear the
brunt of unknown trials for his sake,
seemed too preposterous to be taken
seriously. And yet what else could he
do?</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said presently, stroking
her silky head as it lay on his breast,
"tell me what is the worst that can
happen to you, Rachel?"</p>

<p>"The worst," sighed Rachel, "will
be hearing Aunt Elizabeth tell me that
I have repaid all her generosity and
kindness to me with ingratitude and
treachery."</p>

<p>"That will be very bad. But you
will have to try and make her understand
the real right and justice of it,
love. She must see it, unless she is
stone blind. She can't expect us to
outrage all the laws of nature to suit<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
her narrow schemes. You don't think
there will be anything still worse?&mdash;that
she will make your life wretched by
making you feel your dependence&mdash;that
kind of thing?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure," said Rachel. "She
has been very, very good to me; but
lately&mdash;since she has got suspicious
about you&mdash;she has been hard. However,
if the worst comes to the worst,
I can go and be a governess or companion
somewhere until you are ready for
me."</p>

<p>"No, Rachel, no; you must promise
to tell me if you are persecuted in any
way&mdash;if you are miserable in your aunt's
house&mdash;and my sister Lily will take care
of you. You are not to let the worst
come to the worst&mdash;do you hear? You
must let me know of anything that<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
happens, and I will come at once and
see about it. Oh, my poor little one, I
begin to realise what sacrifices you
will have to make for me! Will you
think the game was worth the candle,
I wonder, when you are as old as I
am?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rachel; "I know I shall&mdash;if
you will be as contented with me
then as you are now."</p>

<p>"Do you <i>really</i> think you have
counted the cost?" he persisted
anxiously. "Remember, you were going
to marry Mr. Kingston, because you
thought it would be nice to be rich
and to live in a grand house and to
wear diamonds."</p>

<p>"That was before I had seen <i>you</i>.
I don't want to be rich now. Indeed,
I would rather not."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>"Has anybody told you how poor I
am?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered, stealing a timid
hand to his shoulder. "I have been
thinking of it. Beatrice says it is a
mistake for poor men to marry&mdash;that
they cripple their career. But I hope&mdash;I
think&mdash;<i>I</i> shall not be any burden
to you. Once I was poor, too, and I
know all about it, and I can manage
with a very little. I think I could help
you in lots of ways, and not be a
hindrance."</p>

<p>"A hindrance, indeed!" he interrupted.
"My darling, if I had you for my companion,
life would be sweet enough for
me, under any circumstances. It was
your comfort and happiness I was thinking
of."</p>

<p>"I only want to be with you," she said,<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
under her breath. "I don't care where&mdash;I
don't care how."</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Rachel?"</p>

<p>"Really, indeed."</p>

<p>"You are so young! Think what a
number of years you have before you,
in all probability. If you should lose
the colour out of your life too soon, if
you should have to drudge&mdash;but I won't
let you drudge," he added, with a sudden
touch of fierceness, "I will take care
of you, and you shall have all you
want. It <i>won't</i> be a sacrifice&mdash;not
even all this"&mdash;looking round him&mdash;"if
you give it up for a man you love, who
has health and strength to work for
you. It would make you miserable if
you had it. You know it would?"</p>

<p>"I do know it," she responded, without
a moment's hesitation.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[180]</span></p>

<p>She had finally made up her mind
that after all material poverty was not
the worst of life's misfortunes. Indeed,
provided the element of debt were
absent, she thought it might in Roden
Dalrymple's company, "far from the
madding crowd," in the lonely wilds
of Queensland, be rather pleasant than
otherwise; for it would mean the delight
of working for and helping one another,
and a blessed freedom from interruption
and restraint in the enjoyment of that
wonderful married life which would be
theirs.</p>

<p>"But I should like to know what
made you take to me," he went on,
in the immemorial fashion, stroking
her soft face. "I should like to
know why you chose, for your first love&mdash;I
am your first, am I not, Rachel?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> you are. And it was no
matter of choice with me&mdash;you know
that, too."</p>

<p>"A man who made shipwreck of his
fortunes for another woman almost before
you were born&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" interrupted Rachel. "I have
no rights in your past, and I don't want
any. This present is mine, and that is
enough for me."</p>

<p>"A battered old vagabond&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she persisted; "I won't allow
you to call yourself a vagabond. It is
bad enough to hear other people do
it."</p>

<p>"After seeing him under what one
would be inclined to consider, well, anything
but favourable auspices&mdash;for how
many days, Rachel?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, hiding a scarlet<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
face, "don't remind me of that! It
was too soon&mdash;but I could not help
it."</p>

<p>"The sooner the better, my sweet&mdash;if
it lasts," he responded, kissing her
with solemn passion; "and I will <i>make</i>
it last."</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid of that," she whispered
eagerly. "I know I am young&mdash;I
know one ought not to be too positive
about the future&mdash;but I <i>feel</i> that it will be
impossible to help loving you always, even
if I try not to, which I certainly shan't.
I am sure I began it when I saw you
riding across the racecourse that day&mdash;I
am sure I shall not stop any more
as long as I live. I don't think there
can be another man in the world like
you."</p>

<p>And so they talked, until it occurred<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
to one of them to wonder what the
time was. Mr. Dalrymple struck a
match and looked at his watch, Rachel
shielding the small flame from the wind
with her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed in dismay,
"what would Aunt Elizabeth say if
she knew I was sitting out here at
eleven o'clock at night!"</p>

<p>"Call it eleven p.m.," he suggested,
looking at her with his slow smile;
"that sounds so much better."</p>

<p>"Did you think it was so late? The
time has flown."</p>

<p>"I <i>felt</i> it flying," he replied. "But
I did not think it was so late. I'm
afraid you must go home, little one.
Oh, dear me, when shall we have
such a time again! Will you come
here to-morrow night, and tell me<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
how you have got over your day's
troubles?"</p>

<p>This was not a proposal that Rachel
could accept comfortably, nor that he
could bring himself to press upon her.
But when they came to reconsider their
position and necessities, it was hard to
find an alternative.</p>

<p>"You see, I must go back to Queensland
in a day or two," Mr. Dalrymple
explained, when, having taken her out
of her hole and dusted her skirts with
his handkerchief, he led her through
the labyrinth of walls into the open
moonlight, and they paused, hand in
hand, for a few last words. "We have
an immense deal to do up there, and
Gordon wants me. I must look after
getting things together for you too.
There is not even a roof for your head<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
yet. But I can't bear to leave town
without knowing first how matters
are likely to go with you."</p>

<p>"If you <i>should</i> be obliged to do that&mdash;if
I <i>cannot</i> see you again," said
Rachel, "when will you come back?"</p>

<p>"I will come back in&mdash;let me see,
this is October&mdash;in two months. I
will be back at Christmas. I should
have liked to see your uncle to-morrow,
just that there should be no mistake
about what I mean to do; but if you
think it will make things harder for
you, I won't, of course. You shall
just tell Kingston what you like, and
the rest of them I will enlighten when
I come. By that time he will be out
of the way and done with, and
we shall have a straight road before
us."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Rachel, sighing; "I
think that will be best. And perhaps,
by that time, Aunt Elizabeth will let
you in."</p>

<p>"If she doesn't, I shall bombard the
house."</p>

<p>"You will be <i>sure</i> to be back at
Christmas?"</p>

<p>"If I am alive, dear, and a free
agent&mdash;certainly. And I shall find you
ready for me then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>With this compact between them, and
the giving to Rachel of her lover's town
address, and very explicit directions as
to where she might find him at any
given hour when she might happen to
want him until the day of his departure,
they kissed one clinging, lingering kiss in
motionless silence, and bade one another<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>&mdash;though
they did not know it&mdash;a long
farewell.</p>

<p>"Which is your window, Rachel?
Can I see it from here?"</p>

<p>She pointed to it in silence, it was
very distinct just now in the moonshine,
between two dark pine trees. She was
crying a little, and she could not
speak.</p>

<p>"I will be here to-morrow night," he
said; "and if you <i>can't</i> come out to
me, have a light in your room at twelve
o'clock, darling, to let me know you are
all right."</p>

<p>And then they separated; and Rachel
felt rather than saw her way home, so
dazzled with tears was she, while Roden
Dalrymple at her desire remained behind
and watched her.</p>

<p>She went straight into the house and<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
upstairs to her room, to gather together,
in a feverish hurry of renunciation, all
her diamonds and jewels, which like
Dead Sea apples, had suddenly become
dust.</p>

<p>And he, long after she was gone,&mdash;long
after Mrs. Hardy's carriage returned,
and all the chimes in the city
had rung the midnight hour&mdash;lingered
where she had left him, leaning his
arms on a convenient wall, watching a
lighted window, and thinking. He was
very happy. He had come unawares
upon his happiness, when he was most
in need of it, and it seemed to him
that it was the best he could have
had.</p>

<p>Anything sweeter than this fresh and
simple heart, which was satisfied
to invest all its wealth in him<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>&mdash;anything
brighter than the future she
had spread before him&mdash;he did not want
or wish for. It was the amplest compensation
that he could imagine for the
mistakes and disappointments of his
wasted past.</p>

<p>And yet, though he was hardly conscious
of it&mdash;though he would not have
owned to it if he had been&mdash;he had a
vague misgiving about her. He did not
wish that she had been less easy to
win; he had no fear that she was mistaking
a sentimental girlish fancy for
love; he did not for a moment apprehend
that she would forsake or wrong
him.</p>

<p>But there was a suggestion of untried
and untested youth about all the circumstances
of this sudden betrothal, as
far as she had influenced them, and there<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
was an intangible suspicion that somewhere
she was weak.</p>

<p>He did not recognise, and therefore
did not formulate, the sentiment that
infused that touch of grave and sad
anxiety into his happy meditations; but,
nevertheless, it was there, and the time
came when it was justified.</p>

  <span class="hide">R</span>ACHEL was not a heroine.
She was simply a sweet and
interesting girl; except that
she was unusually pretty, by no means
above the ordinary level of nice girls.
She was better than a great many
that we are acquainted with, no
doubt, but she was not so good as
some.</p>

<p>And she had, as has been already
indicated, that fault which, of all<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
faults, perhaps, is most common to
girls, whether nice or otherwise&mdash;that
amiable weakness that is more disastrous
in its consequences than many a
downright vice&mdash;she was, if not quite
a coward, cowardly.</p>

<p>She was afraid to meet difficulties
in the open, as it were&mdash;to attack the
main body and scatter them, and have
done with it; she sheltered herself
in ambush, and made desultory attacks
on flank and rear with temporary
compromises, hating the thought of
duplicity and longing to do right, yet
most of all dreading the violent, harsh
hurt to tender sensibilities (whether
her own or other people's) that was
inevitable in the shock of a pitched
battle.</p>

<p>It is a defect in a woman's character<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
very much to be deplored, of course,
and it is one that seems unpardonable
to a strong-minded person.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is much more of a
misfortune than a fault (and we may
as well say the same, while we are
about it, of all our constitutional
defects, from red hair to kleptomania,
since we did not choose our parents
nor the social conditions to which we
were born); and to Rachel, whose
instinctive truthfulness and high sense
of moral rectitude prompted her to
struggle hard, if vainly, against it, it
was purely a misfortune, and at no
time in her life more so than
now.</p>

<p>For, after turning the question over
and over in her mind through all that
feverish and wakeful night, she finally<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
decided that in breaking off her
engagement with Mr. Kingston she
would not mention, either to him or
to anyone else, the place that Mr.
Dalrymple now occupied in her affections
and affairs.</p>

<p>As no one was aware of their
having met, and as he was coming
back himself so soon to clear up
everything much better than she could,
she persuaded herself that it would
be not only unnecessary, but in
the highest degree inexpedient, to
aggravate the inevitable pain and difficulty
that was before her and all of
them.</p>

<p>Hating his very name as they did,
would she not expose her lover to
insult, and his motives and actions
to misconception, and probably prejudice<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
their chances of happiness irrevocably?</p>

<p>And at the same time do no good
whatever, but only add an element
of unspeakable bitterness to the disappointment
of her aunt, and to the
mortification of her already ill-used
and much-wronged <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, and, as a
matter of detail, an incalculable amount
of difficulty to her own sufficiently
formidable task? She was certain that
she would, and she felt that she could
not, and need not do it.</p>

<p>It took her all night to mature
her course of action, but having
finally brought herself to believe that
it was not only so much the easiest
to herself, but in every way the best
for all concerned, to ignore Mr.
Dalrymple for the present, she committed<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
herself to it by writing a long
letter to Mr. Kingston&mdash;a tender, penitent,
self-accusing letter, in which she
begged him to forgive her for having
discovered so much too late that they
were unsuited to one another, and
prayed that he might some day be
happier with a better woman than it
was in her power to make him, and
that he would ever believe her his
attached and grateful friend, without
suggesting the existence or possibility
of any other lover, present or to be.</p>

<p>The natural results followed. Mr.
Kingston, seeing no sufficient reason
for these sudden strong measures,
refused to treat them seriously.</p>

<p>He was quite aware, and it troubled
him deeply, that she was not happy
in her engagement, and he was very<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
jealous and suspicious of Mr. Dalrymple,
whom he had seen once or
twice about town; but he had set his
heart upon her, as we say, with the
perverse obstinacy of a fickle man who
had been spoiled by women's flattery,
and the more she seemed to shrink
from him the more he wanted to have
her, and the more he was determined
not to let her go if he could possibly
help it.</p>

<p>His love not only lacked reciprocity&mdash;without
which love is never worthy
to be spelt with a capital L&mdash;but it
was so diluted with all sorts of vanities
and egotisms that, though its flavour
was there, the potent spirit was absent,
and he was incapable of making a sacrifice
for her happiness at the expense
of his own.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>When he solemnly assured himself
that he loved her as he had never
loved anyone before, and that he could
not and would not give her up&mdash;when
he declared, moreover, that he was
ready to spend his future life in her
service, and would take his chance of
making her care for him&mdash;he not only
told the truth, as far as he understood
it, but perhaps he touched the
highest point of heroism of which his
selfish nature was capable.</p>

<p>All the same, the strong necessities
of the case were the carrying out of
the great enterprise which was symbolised
by the half-built house, and
the realisation of his schemes for his
own enjoyment; the possession (and
the securing from other men) of the
most attractive, the most admired,<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
and to him most loveable woman of
his set, who had so to speak given
him a legal lien upon her person;
the maintenance of his social position
and dignity, and the avoidance of
ridicule and embarrassment.</p>

<p>So when he had read Rachel's letter,
with a great expense of bad language
in the first place, and of wise reflection
subsequently, he made up his
mind that it was merely the result of
their Adelonga differences, which had
been rankling in her sensitive heart,
and not the formal resignation that he
would be required to accept.</p>

<p>"No, no, young lady," he said to
himself, as he made a careful toilet
before setting forth to see her, "I
have not sacrificed my liberty and all
my comfortable habits, at your instigation<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
and for your sake, to take
my <i>cong&eacute;</i> at the eleventh hour in this
way."</p>

<p>And then he cast about in his
mind anxiously for ways and means
whereby he might meet and overcome
this strange reluctance, which not only
seemed to him a cruel injury and
injustice after all he had done for
her, but really distressed him acutely,
and made him extremely unhappy.</p>

<p>Was there anything amongst Kilpatrick's
glittering treasures that would
tempt her to smile and kiss him, and
be sorry that she had given him this
heartless blow?</p>

<p>He felt to-day that he would spend
a thousand pounds cheerfully for anything
that would please her.</p>

<p>But at the same time he was<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
uneasily conscious that even the largest
and purest diamonds would not appreciably
affect the situation.</p>

<p>She was no longer open to these
fascinations, as she used to be; several
little circumstances had convinced him
of that.</p>

<p>It was a bad sign, he feared; but
he hoped it indicated nothing more
serious than that the novelty of wealth
and luxury had worn off.</p>

<p>He recognised its existence so far
that he went on his delicate mission
to Toorak, trusting to his own merits
and eloquence, with no bribes of any
sort in his pocket.</p>

<p>After all, he did not see Rachel that
day. She was weeping hysterically in
her bedroom at the top of the house,
and therefore was not presentable.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy, much excited and discomposed
by the shock she had just
received (on being told by Rachel that
she had not only written a letter to
her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, to break off her engagement,
but had <i>sent</i> it), received him in
the drawing-room, and did the best
that wisdom, at such short notice,
suggested to repair the catastrophe
which she had been powerless to
prevent.</p>

<p>She tried to smile and joke, in a
considerate and well-bred manner; she
rallied him upon his misconduct in the
matter of Miss Hale, which had evidently
been at the bottom of all the
mischief, gently pointing out to him
that a sensitive nature like Rachel's,
and a tender heart that loved and
trusted him, could not be played with,<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
even in the conventional fashion, with
impunity.</p>

<p>And then she hastened to explain
the suddenness and unexpectedness of
this "freak;" how sure she was that
it had been perpetrated under the
influence of a fit of temper or dejection,
or some other unhealthy condition
of mind; how equally sure she was
that it was already repented of&mdash;though,
of course, it was not for her
to give an opinion or to interfere. All
of which would have been very proper
and sensible, but that the effect was
marred by a bubbling under-current of
angry excitement that her utmost efforts
could not hide.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingston watched and listened,
with smiling self-possession. Finding
that he was not to see Rachel, nor to<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
get any fresh information, he did not
prolong the interview. He had no
confidence in Mrs. Hardy&mdash;few men
had, in matters of this kind. He received
her communications in a friendly
manner, as one receives an embassy
under a flag of truce; he never thought
of allowing himself to be influenced by
them one way or the other, or of
asking her assistance and advice.</p>

<p>As soon as courtesy permitted, he
bowed himself out of her presence, with
magnanimous expressions of good-will
and a request that nothing might be
be said or done to distress or embarrass
Rachel. And then he got into his cab
thoughtfully, and went to South Yarra
to call on Mrs. Reade.</p>

<p>It was not one of this young lady's
reception days, as no one knew better<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
than himself; nor had she left her
house in pursuit of tea and gossip at
other people's "afternoons," as he half
expected would be the case.</p>

<p>The sprightly maid-servant (all Mrs.
Reade's servants were maids, and all of
them sprightly), who opened the door
to his thundering knock, recognising a
privileged friend of the family, admitted
him with alacrity; and he walked into
the drawing-room and found his hostess
sitting there alone, nestling in one of
her seductive low chairs with an open
letter on her knee.</p>

<p>She, too, had just received the news
of Rachel's escapade; the letter, full
of dashing and incoherent sentences,
was in Mrs. Hardy's handwriting, and
had arrived half an hour ago from
Toorak. But there were no signs of<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
excitement and discomposure about this
little person, who rose to meet him,
looking cool and bright, with even
the suspicion of a twinkle in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Have you come for a gossip?" she
asked, looking up at him with friendly
frankness. "Because if you have you
had better send your cab away. I am
going out at five o'clock, and I'll drive
you into town."</p>

<p>The cab was sent away; and Mr.
Kingston, with a feeling of comfort
and safety about him, sat down in a
bow-windowed recess, in his favourite
of all the cunningly-devised chairs, and
with his elbows on his knees, began to
fiddle with the top of a silk sock, at
the toe of which his companion was
now knitting industriously.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>"Is this for Ned?" he inquired, after
a pause.</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that a superfluous question?"
she replied, holding it up.
"Look at the size of it. Could any
foot but his fill out that enormous
bag? Of course it is for Ned. Don't
you know it is the new fashion for
wives to knit their husband's socks?
One must be in the fashion, even if
one's husband is a giant."</p>

<p>"Very nice for one's husband. It
seems beautifully soft; pretty colour,
too." Then, after a pause, "Does
Rachel know how to knit?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Reade, calmly;
"we both learned together while she
was staying with me, and she does it
much quicker than I do. I suppose
you are thinking you would like to<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
participate in the benefits of the fashion
too?" she added, lifting her face suddenly,
with a quick look in her bright
eyes that was like the opening of a
masked battery.</p>

<p>"If I thought that Rachel would
ever knit socks for me, for the pleasure
of it&mdash;&mdash;" He paused with a change
and break in his voice, regarding her
wistfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade immediately made a sheaf
of her needles, wound them up in the
sock, and impaled her ball of silk upon
them. "Tell me," she said, folding her
hands on her knees in a business-like
manner, "tell me, what has Rachel been
doing?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? She has written
to me to break off our engagement."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>"I can't imagine&mdash;she doesn't say. I
thought <i>you</i> might be able to help me
to find that out."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade looked at him in silence
for a few seconds, kindly and gravely.
Even she felt herself a little at a loss
as to what course to pursue.</p>

<p>"What have you done?" she asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I went up to see her just
now, but I was disappointed. She could
not, or would not, come in. I rather
fancy your mother had been scolding
her."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt she had. She
doesn't approve of independence on the
part of young people."</p>

<p>"I won't have her scolded," Mr.
Kingston broke out, with sudden
vehemence. "If I like to blame her,<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
that is another matter. I won't have
her set against me by other people.
Nothing would make her hate me more
than that kind of thing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade felt the justice of this
protest, but she did not see fit to
discuss her mother's little mistakes.
"What are you going to do?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Do you mean am I going to take
my dismissal in this off-hand way? No,
certainly not. After all the time we
have been engaged&mdash;after all that has
come and gone between us&mdash;after all
the preparations that have been made&mdash;it
would be <i>too</i> preposterous! I
should be the laughing-stock of the
colony."</p>

<p>"That would be very sad," said Mrs.
Reade, with her head on one side.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>"Now be a good little woman, and
don't jeer at me&mdash;I didn't come to you
for that. You know&mdash;or you ought to
know&mdash;that I am horribly upset and
miserable about all this business, and
that I want you to help me."</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can help you,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Tell me about Rachel. What is
the matter with her? What does she
mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, evidently she means that she
doesn't want to marry you," sighed Mrs.
Reade. "Tiresome child, why didn't
she think of it before?"</p>

<p>"Why should she think of it now?
Oh, yes, I know she has not been keen
about it for some time, as she should
have been. But she has not seemed to
<i>dislike</i> it; she has looked forward to<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
it as much a matter of course as&mdash;as
it has been to all the rest of
us. And I felt so sure it would be
all right&mdash;that I could make her as
happy as possible&mdash;when we were
once married and she had settled
down!"</p>

<p>It was not often that Mrs. Reade was
perplexed, but now&mdash;between her duty
to her family, her strong affection for
Rachel, and her desire to assist her
friend&mdash;she really did not know what
to do. While she was silent, struggling
with the dilemma in her active mind,
Mr. Kingston went on.</p>

<p>"It is since she went to Adelonga
that she has changed so much. Haven't
you noticed?"</p>

<p>"You did not behave very well to her
at Adelonga, you know."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>"Who told you that? Did she?"</p>

<p>"Never mind who told me. There is
never any secrecy about your proceedings&mdash;I
will give you that credit.
You treated her very badly at Lucilla's
ball."</p>

<p>"Not worse than she treated me,"
he began, impetuously; and then he
paused and looked at his hostess. He
was gentleman enough to shrink from
discussing Rachel's misdeeds in connection
with "that Dalrymple fellow,"
but he longed to find out how much
her wise cousin and late companion
knew. Mrs. Reade fingered her knitting
with a placid and impenetrable
face.</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;you know Rachel so intimately&mdash;do
you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do I think what?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[214]</span></p>

<p>"That there is anyone she cares for&mdash;more
than she cares for me?"</p>

<p>He was impelled, against his better
judgment, to ask this awkward question.
Mrs. Reade gathered herself together,
so to speak; it was one of those
sudden emergencies that inspire a brave
woman.</p>

<p>"If I thought she cared for anyone
who was a better man, and could make
her happier than you," she said deliberately,
looking him straight in the face,
"she should have him, or it would not
be my fault."</p>

<p>"But she does not?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know she does not.
But," she was an honest little woman,
and it gave her a pang to mislead
him, even though she did it for what
seemed to her a good end, "but, at<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
the same time, no doubt she does
not care for you as she ought to
do."</p>

<p>"I hope that will come," he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>If only Mr. Dalrymple did not stand
in his way, he felt all difficulties manageable.</p>

<p>"It is a great risk; you ought to
think well before you take it."</p>

<p>"I have thought well."</p>

<p>"And I will be no party to making
<i>her</i> take it against her will."</p>

<p>"But I think she will be willing if
she is treated properly. Of course I
don't want to marry her by force. I
want to bring her round to like it as
she used to like it. If there is nobody
else, why not? And you <i>will</i> help me,
won't you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Reade looked at him with bright
and friendly eyes. He was really taking
it very well considering how badly he
had been treated, and how extremely
susceptible he was to indignities of
this, or indeed any description. He
certainly must be strangely in love
with that perverse child, she thought&mdash;much
more in love than she had
ever expected to see him&mdash;to be able
to put his wrongs in the background
like this. He deserved to be helped.</p>

<p>And as far as human judgment was
to be trusted, to help him would be to
play Providence to Rachel.</p>

<p>"I will do what I can," she said
kindly. "That is to say, I won't
interfere, but I'll give you good advice
whenever you do me the honour to
ask for it."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you; I ask for it now. What
do you advise me to do?"</p>

<p>She pondered a few moments, watching
him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure, once for all,
that you think it worth while to
throw yourself away on an ungrateful
little monkey who doesn't appreciate
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm quite sure I want to marry
Rachel. I hope she will appreciate me,
but if she doesn't&mdash;well, I want to marry
her all the same."</p>

<p>"And are willing to take the consequences?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I'm not afraid of consequences&mdash;once
the wedding is over."</p>

<p>He smiled as he made this almost
sacrilegious assertion, which implied a
marital control of consequences that was<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
offensive in the ears of the little woman,
who liked to see husbands kept in their
proper places.</p>

<p>"Don't boast," she said sharply, "you
might find yourself in a very unpleasant
position when the wedding was
over. And you will, too, if you don't
mind."</p>

<p>The dialogue was interrupted at this
point. A little brougham rattled past
the window on its way from the
stable-yard to the front-door, and a
servant came in with tea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade looked at her watch, and
her guest's face fell.</p>

<p>"Is it five o'clock?" he exclaimed testily;
"and you have not given me any
advice!"</p>

<p>"Will you have a cup of tea?" she
inquired, coolly.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[219]</span></p>

<p>"No, thank you. <i>Must</i> you go out this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Well, I could hardly countermand
the carriage now, because you are here,
could I? We'll have a drive somewhere
before we go in to town,
and I'll give you advice as we go
along."</p>

<p>She drank her tea standing in the
middle of the room, and then leaving
him to fret and fume by himself, went
away to dress, and in the retirement
of her own apartment to concoct a
definite scheme of action.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she came back alert
and bright, in a very charming French
bonnet, and with yards of silken train
behind her. She was ready for him in
every sense of the word.</p>

<p>As soon as they were out upon the<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
road, and she had finished buttoning
a refractory glove, she said gravely,
with an air of having solved all
doubts,</p>

<p>"Now I will tell you what you must
do."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You must accept Rachel's dismissal."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i> I'm sure I shall not do anything
of the kind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade laid herself back in the
carriage and folded her hands.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, calmly.</p>

<p>"No, but really&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;I
don't understand you. Do you mean
I must just give her up and have done
with it? Because you know it is just
that that I can't do."</p>

<p>"Not at all. But don't ask my
opinion&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, <i>do</i> tell me what you
mean."</p>

<p>"Well, I was going to suggest that
you see or write to Rachel and tell her
you will do what she wishes rather than
distress her; but that, while leaving her
free, you will consider yourself still as
much bound to her as ever, and wait
in hope that she will come back to you
someday. That kind of thing, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that is all very well. And
in the meantime I shall be getting old&mdash;that
is to say, I shall be losing time&mdash;and
she will be sure to be run after
by other men the moment my back is
turned."</p>

<p>"It will be better to lose a little time
than to worry her now," said Mrs.
Reade. "If you draw off from her a
little, she will miss you, and then probably<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
she will want you, and provided
you left her assured of your faithfulness,
and didn't go flirting with Miss
Hale and people, it would be just the
kind of delicate and chivalrous consideration
for her that she would appreciate.
Yes, I know Rachel; it would
touch her heart deeply."</p>

<p>"But some other fellow might get
hold of her&mdash;finding she was free, you
know."</p>

<p>"I think," said Mrs. Reade, smiling
slightly, "that we may safely leave my
mother to look after that."</p>

<p>Upon consideration Mr. Kingston
thought so too. He began to see
glimmerings of wisdom and reason in
this proposed course.</p>

<p>"But your mother will have to be
looked after herself," he said, breaking<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
a little pause abruptly. "If <i>I</i> am not
to worry Rachel, nobody else shall."</p>

<p>"Of course. I will look after my
mother."</p>

<p>"And suppose," he continued presently,
deep in troubled thoughts, "suppose
she never renews the engagement
after all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;suppose the world comes
to an end to-morrow&mdash;we can't help
it!"</p>

<p>"Do you think she will?"</p>

<p>"I do think she will&mdash;honestly, I
do&mdash;if you are patient and gentle, and
do as I tell you. She will be dull
and lonely; she will miss you about
her, and not only you, but many
pleasant things that are associated with
you; she will bethink herself that she
has treated you badly&mdash;as indeed she<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
has&mdash;and she is so tender-hearted that
it will fret her. And if she sees you
occasionally, not in season and out of
season, but now and then, at opportune
times, and you do her little voluntary
services in a delicate and unobtrusive
way&mdash;then some of these days, seeing
you still, she will suddenly think that
she loves you, and&mdash;well, then it will be
all right, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so!" he broke out, with
a deep, impatient sigh&mdash;though it was
not a great deal to hope for when it
came to be reckoned up. "But how
long will she be reaching that point?"</p>

<p>"It depends."</p>

<p>"And we were to have been married
in a couple of months&mdash;three at the
most. Upon my honour, it <i>is</i> too
bad!"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if you were
married quite as soon as you arranged
to be," Mrs. Reade proceeded calmly,
building this comfortable theory upon
the conviction that Mr. Dalrymple, in
spite of his persistence in calling at
Toorak, was not the kind of man to
remain faithful to a ball-room fancy,
nor to undertake anything so expensive
and so respectable as matrimony under
the most favourable conjunction of circumstances;
and feeling sure that Rachel,
with her clinging, impulsive nature,
finding her desires frustrated in this
direction, would be under an imperious
necessity to seek&mdash;or, at any rate, to
accept&mdash;support elsewhere. "If I had
her with me for six weeks, I think
I would not mind risking a small
bet&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>"<i>Can't</i> you have her with you?" Mr.
Kingston interposed eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, I fear not. My mother would
not consent to let her go from home
just now. The situation is too grave.
But even as things are, if you manage
the child properly, I don't at all despair
of seeing you married&mdash;or, at any rate,
engaged again&mdash;before the year is out.
Very far from it."</p>

<p>"I would give a thousand pounds
at this moment if I could be certain
that that would be," sighed Mr. Kingston,
plaintively.</p>

<p>"Only you must do what I tell you.
I assure you, if you <i>want</i> to succeed,
that is your best, if not your only
chance. Will you do what I tell
you?"</p>

<p>"I will see Rachel first."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>"Of course. See her and give her
plainly to understand what a pain
and disappointment it is to you to give
her up, and that you only do it for her
sake. Perhaps, if you talk it over with
her, she will cancel her letter, and it
will be all right at once; in which case
you had better arrange for your marriage
as quickly as possible. But if it should
be otherwise&mdash;if she should still press
for a dissolution of her engagement&mdash;let
her go for a little while. It need not
be for long."</p>

<p>"I think I will," said Mr. Kingston,
thoughtfully. And he did.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-m.jpg" alt="M"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">M</span>RS. READE was accustomed
not only to give advice and
to see it taken, but to see
the wisdom of it justified in the success
of its practical application.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was more surprised
than Mr. Kingston himself at the great
and good results which apparently followed
her interference in his affairs.
Matters were a little critical for a week
or two.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>

<p>Of course he "saw" Rachel, and
attacked the position which she had
taken up with all the forces at his
command. He was, in his Mentor's
judgment, indiscreetly zealous and persevering;
and the almost fierce obstinacy
of Rachel's resistance, which neither
science nor brute force could overcome,
being an altogether anomalous demonstration
of character, was even more
portentous.</p>

<p>But when presently Mr. Kingston, in
a dignified and graceful letter, accepted
his defeat, while at the same time
clearly intimating that the withdrawal
of his former pretensions in no way
indicated any change in his affections
and fidelity, then everything seemed to
go well.</p>

<p>The girl <i>was</i> touched and grieved to<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
the depths of her tender heart for the
wrong and the trouble that she had
inflicted upon him, and was in agonies
of anxiety for his welfare.</p>

<p>"Do you think he will go back to
Miss Brownlow?" she inquired one day
of Beatrice, with pathetic eyes full of
tears; "and, oh, <i>do</i> you think she will
make him happy?"</p>

<p>She was terribly taken aback when
her cousin with much asperity upbraided
her with the heartlessness of the suggestion.</p>

<p>For a little while, having received her
aunt's grudging acquiescence in the dissolution
of her engagement, having sent
back all her jewels, having surreptitiously
despatched a note to her lover in
Queensland (which she implored him not
to answer) to tell him that she was<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
honourably free, and living in the
anticipation of his return, Rachel began
to blossom in beauty and brightness
again, like a flower that night had
chilled in the warmth of morning
sunshine.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, a little discouraging
to see how very much relieved and
refreshed she was in her freedom&mdash;that
she did not even hanker after her lost
diamonds, and the riches and luxuries
that had once been so desirable and
so precious; but Mrs. Reade, as was
her custom, looked below the surface
of things, and found her compensations.</p>

<p>That the girl had recovered her
balance, so to speak, and was in sound
health, mentally and physically, was of
the first importance in this sensible<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
young woman's view of the case; and
her eager friendliness to Mr. Kingston
whenever she met him&mdash;eager in proportion
to the modesty of his demands
of course, and sometimes warm
with impulsive tenderness such as she
had never voluntarily manifested in
the days of her engagement&mdash;seemed to
foreshadow the most hopeful possibilities.
Indeed, if Mr. Kingston behaved
well, Rachel, apart from her
specific misdemeanour, behaved even
better.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy, outwardly conforming to
her daughter's scheme, would not, or
could not, disguise her resentment at
the failure of the original enterprise,
and visited it upon the girl, as perhaps
was natural, more roughly than she
would have done had Rachel been her<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
own child or less deeply indebted to
her.</p>

<p>She was ostentatiously cold and indifferent,
or she was sarcastic, and harsh,
and rude; she was rigorous to the
verge of tyranny in her determination
to allow no other man the smallest
opportunity for improving the occasion
in the manner that Mr. Kingston had
indicated&mdash;withdrawing her niece from
all the gay assemblies where she
had hitherto disported herself with
so much enjoyment and <i>&eacute;clat</i>, and
keeping her to a petty routine of
study and household duties that was
made as dull and irksome as
possible.</p>

<p>Yet Rachel, always so sensitive to
both kindness and unkindness, and as
much hurt by a snub as she would<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
have been by a blow, took it all with
the sweetest patience and temper.</p>

<p>She devoted herself to her aunt's
service as she never had done before,
compassing the sombre woman with
every possible delicate attention that
tact and thoughtfulness could devise;
and she not only persevered in this
amiable conduct, but kept a certain
placid and gentle brightness about her,
under all discouragements, for weeks
and weeks together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade, as a matter of course,
was greatly touched and pleased; for
it was evident&mdash;as far as her sharp
eyes could see&mdash;that Mr. Dalrymple
was not the source of inspiration <i>now</i>,
seeing that he had been effectually
circumvented on his first attempt to
renew her acquaintance, and had never<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
been seen or heard of since. It seemed
to the anxious little woman that the
girl had only wanted her freedom for
awhile, and that, by and bye, by the
mere drift of the current, she would be
borne back to the arms that were waiting
for her.</p>

<p>Things seemed to be going on so
well that Mrs. Reade, when the gaieties
of the "Cup" season were over, thought
she might venture to leave town for a
few weeks. She wanted very much to
pay a long-deferred visit to Adelonga.</p>

<p>She had not been there since Lucilla
was a bride, and of course she had
not seen the baby. She was also
anxious to find out for herself "the
rights" of the story that her mother
had told her concerning Rachel's conduct
and experiences while sojourning under<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
her sister's roof, and if possible to
make the acquaintance of some of Mr.
Dalrymple's people.</p>

<p>So, with customary promptitude, she
made her preparations. She sent for
Mr. Kingston and gave him judicious
advice and encouragement to direct and
uphold him in her absence.</p>

<p>Then she interviewed Mrs. Hardy, and
expressed herself so strongly on behalf
of her own views as to what was
right and proper in the management of
Rachel's case, that they nearly came
to "words."</p>

<p>And, finally, having fortified the position
to the best of her power, she
sought out Rachel herself, and, in the
privacy of that little chamber at the top
of the house, bade her an affectionate
and reluctant good-bye.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>"I don't know if my mother has
told you, dear, that Lucilla wanted me
very much to bring you with me,"
she said, when they were sitting
together by Rachel's window, hand in
hand.</p>

<p>"Did she? Dear Lucilla, how I
should like to see her!" ejaculated
Rachel, but not in the tone of voice
that Mrs. Reade had expected.</p>

<p>"And I begged very hard for permission,
but mamma thought it better
not to interrupt your music and painting
lessons again so soon. It is a
great disappointment to you not to
go, isn't it? At first I thought
I would not tell you anything about
it."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I am glad you told me,"
said Rachel; "for I must send a message<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
to Lucilla to thank her. She
knows how I loved to be at Adelonga&mdash;I
think it is the sweetest place in the
wide world."</p>

<p>"I wish I could take you," said
Mrs. Reade; "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Beatrice, I cannot go, I
know. Indeed, I would rather not. I
would rather stay with Aunt Elizabeth,
and go on with my lessons."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade was considerably astonished
and disconcerted by this
evidently genuine sentiment. There
was <i>something</i> in so ready a relinquishment
of the pleasures of Adelonga,
which had always been so great, and
also in the tremulous eagerness with
which the girl put the proposal from
her&mdash;a proposal which Mrs. Reade
had feared would be cruelly tantalising<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
at this time; but it was not immediately
apparent.</p>

<p>Rachel could not stand the silent
scrutiny of her cousin's brilliant eyes.
Blushing violently, she rose from the
couch on which she had been sitting,
and rested her arms on the window-sill,
and looked out upon the
sombre pine trees that stood perfectly
motionless in the golden summer
air.</p>

<p>"Do you see how that house is
getting on?" she said, breaking an
awkward pause. "The walls are simply
<i>rushing</i> up. They will be ready for the
roof directly."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade stood on tiptoe and
peeped over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I wonder you have the heart to
look at it," she replied.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[240]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, Beatrice!"</p>

<p>"I do, when you think what a wreck
you have made of all the hopes and
plans that that poor dear man has been
building with it."</p>

<p>"He will build some more, and better
ones, by and bye, I hope."</p>

<p>"Not he. Men don't do that so
easily at his age."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she persisted, imploringly,
"I think he will, indeed. He did it
very easily with me."</p>

<p>"For an exceedingly good reason&mdash;because
he loved you from the
first. Oh, you ungrateful little monkey,
it's to be hoped you'll die an ugly old
maid!"</p>

<p>"That would be better than being
the wife for years and years of a man
I did not love."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<p>"Rubbish. As if one could have
everything all at once in this world.
You girls think of nothing but yourselves.
You don't take into account
that it might be worth while to make
somebody else happy."</p>

<p>"How could I make him happy
unless I loved him, Beatrice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk about it. You have
pleased yourself, I suppose, and he
must do the best he can. He is
terribly miserable as he is, poor
fellow; but I daresay he'll get over
it."</p>

<p>"Is he miserable <i>now</i>?" inquired
Rachel anxiously. "Have you seen
him lately?"</p>

<p>"I saw him yesterday, and he told
me that his life had no value for him
now that he had lost you, and that he<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
should never live in his house unless
you were the mistress of it. I
shouldn't imagine he felt particularly
jolly under those circumstances. However,
it is no use worrying ourselves
on his account," the little woman added
cheerfully, seeing tears in her cousin's
gentle eyes.</p>

<p>"But I am so sorry for him!"</p>

<p>"That won't help him much, my
dear. And if <i>you</i> are happy, I suppose
that is all we need care
about."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Beatrice!"</p>

<p>"We haven't time to fret over
other people's troubles," Mrs. Reade
proceeded, in what Rachel thought an
exceedingly heartless manner; "life is
too short."</p>

<p>"But, Beatrice&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>"Now, I can't talk about Mr.
Kingston any more. I have all my
packing to do yet, and I must run
away and see after it. Good-bye,
dearest child. Mind you write often.
I wish you were going with me&mdash;I
can't bear to leave you behind."</p>

<p>Rachel flung her arms round her
small cousin with characteristic fervour.</p>

<p>"When do you think you will come
home again?" she inquired tremulously,
almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"I can't say, dear, exactly."</p>

<p>"Before Christmas, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I think so; it will all depend on
circumstances."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> be back by Christmas,"
Rachel pleaded, with an almost tragic<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
eagerness. "It would be dreadful
if Christmas came and you were so
far away!"</p>

<p>"Am I so necessary to the festivities
of the season?" laughed Mrs. Reade,
much touched and flattered. "Well,
I'll see what I can do. Suppose I try
and bring Lucilla and the children
back, and make a regular family gathering
of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you <i>could</i>!" sighed
Rachel.</p>

<p>All the terrors of her time of trial
would be gone, she thought, if she
could have these two faithful cousins
beside her.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Reade went off by the morning
train, tolerably easy in her mind.
She took her big husband with her,
"to keep him," as she said, "out of<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
mischief;" and she stayed away much
longer than she had intended to
do. She was delighted with Adelonga,
and with her sister's companionship.</p>

<p>Ned, also, while being kept in order,
enjoyed himself excessively; and as
long as he was "good" in the matter
of his besetting sin, his lady and
mistress liked him to enjoy himself.
There were plenty of bush gaieties in
the shape of sporting meetings and
balls, and the time slipped away
rapidly, as time at Adelonga usually
did.</p>

<p>A dance at the Digbys' gave Mrs.
Reade the desired opportunity for
making the acquaintance of Mr. Dalrymple's
people, and she learned a few
facts with respect to that gentleman<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
which, while considerably aggravating
her alarm, tended to modify and dignify
the impressions of him that her mother
had given her.</p>

<p>Lucilla showed her a fine photograph
of his powerful, melancholy, highbred
face, and she was quite overcome
by it.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" she said to herself,
with a sort of angry dismay, "it is
no wonder that Rachel was infatuated.
If <i>I</i> had had attentions from that
man&mdash;little as I am given to falling in
love&mdash;I think I should have been as
bad as she."</p>

<p>When Christmas came the sisters
were still at Adelonga. Lucilla could
not leave home, and persuaded Beatrice
not to leave her. They contented
themselves with sending pretty presents<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
and many loving messages and excuses
to their relatives in Melbourne, and
plunged into a series of festive
entertainments that lasted for several
weeks.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, as she was dressing
for a ball, Mrs. Reade was startled to
receive a letter from her mother, begging
her to return to town at once,
as Rachel was very ill.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-m.jpg" alt="M"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">M</span>RS. READE lost no time in
obeying her mother's summons.
In two days she was back in
Melbourne, and having given ten
minutes to the inspection of her
domestic affairs, and refreshed herself
with tea and bread and butter, she
went on to Toorak in the carriage that
had brought her from the station,<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
without even waiting to change her
travelling-dress.</p>

<p>At Toorak she found things in a
most discouraging and deplorable condition&mdash;as
they never would have been,
she told herself, had she remained in
town.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy, who met her in the
hall, and took her to her own room
for elaborate explanations, was herself
a most puzzling and unsatisfactory
feature in the case, for she made it
evident to her daughter's keen perception
that something more had
happened than was accounted for in
her rather disconnected narrative, and
that she did not intend to disclose
what it was.</p>

<p>There was a touch of nervous recklessness
and defiance in the way she<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
spoke of Rachel's illness&mdash;as if the
poor child had crowned a systematic
series of misdemeanours by falling ill
on purpose&mdash;and of her hearty regret
that she had ever had anything to do
with such a perverse and ungrateful
girl, which conveyed to Mrs. Reade
the impression that her cousin had in
some way been persecuted, or had
at any rate, been subjected to more
heroic treatment than her own judgment
and advice had sanctioned.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances it was,
perhaps, natural that her mother
should be somewhat reserved, since
to be fully confidential would be to
confess that she had made mistakes;
but this sudden reversal of old habits,
occurring at this important crisis in
the family fortunes, was a serious<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
aggravation of the already sufficient
difficulties that the little woman had to
deal with.</p>

<p>What complicated her task still
further was the discovery that Mr.
Kingston was again a frequent visitor
at the house, and a strong suspicion
that he was cognisant of those unauthorised
measures&mdash;whatever they
were&mdash;which she was not to hear of.
The only thing she could hope for
was that Rachel would make a clean
breast of all her secrets.</p>

<p>"And if she trusts me, I will
stand her friend against them all,"
declared the baffled conspirator to
herself, as she sat and listened to her
mother's tangled story.</p>

<p>It appeared that Rachel's first signs
of illness had become apparent very<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
soon after the Reades had left town.
She began to fade in colour and to
fail in appetite, and grew nervous,
flighty, and restless; and, upon investigation,
it was discovered that
she had lost the habit of sleeping as
a healthy girl should sleep at night.</p>

<p>The family doctor was called in,
who, amongst other remedies prescribed
a return to horse exercise, which,
since the breaking-off of her engagement,
had been abandoned; and Mr.
Kingston thereupon begged so earnestly
that she would ride Black Agnes
again, that she reluctantly consented
to do so to please him.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingston behaved most delicately,
it was explained, and did not force
himself upon her in her rides. She
always went out with William.<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
"Always," however, turned out to be
only twice, and on both occasions the
carriage had accompanied her with Mr.
Kingston in it.</p>

<p>Just before Christmas she refused
to ride any more, and she behaved
in the most rude and ill-bred manner
to Mr. Kingston. On Christmas Day
she was <i>very</i> aggravating&mdash;in what
way did not appear&mdash;and Mrs. Hardy
had to "speak" to her; and the result
was that she flew into a violent
passion, and then had a fit of
hysterics, and then fainted dead away,
and did not come round for nearly
five minutes.</p>

<p>"I don't recognise Rachel in any
of those performances," remarked Mrs.
Reade. "Why did you not send for
me then, mother?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[254]</span></p>

<p>"Because I thought it was nothing
but a temporary attack. The weather
was sultry&mdash;she was full of whims and
fancies. What could you have done if
you had come? And she was better
again next day."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, when I was doing all
I could to nurse and take care of
her, she went out of a warm room one
night, and rambled about the garden
or somewhere in a heavy dew, and
got her feet wet. Wasn't it <i>too</i> bad?
I could have <i>shaken</i> her when I
saw her come in, with a face as
white as ashes, and chilled to her
very bones!"</p>

<p>"She caught cold, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Of course she did. And then she
had a touch of fever&mdash;what else was<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
to be expected? Her pulse was very
high, and she was excited, and
inclined to be delirious&mdash;indeed, we had
as much as we could do to manage
her. It did not last long, and it
was really nothing but the consequences
of her imprudence, the
doctor said&mdash;and there was a little
low kind of fever going about just
now&mdash;and he did not think her constitution
was very strong. He says
she will soon be all right, with care;
and indeed, the fever is quite allayed
since I wrote to you, and any little
danger that there might have been
is over. But she keeps low. She
doesn't seem to gain strength&mdash;and
no wonder, considering we can't
get her to eat anything. I am
glad you have come back; perhaps<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
you will have more influence with
her than I have."</p>

<p>"I suppose I may go up?" Mrs.
Reade inquired, after a pause. Her
mother gave her permission readily; it
was a great surprise and relief to her
to find herself spared the searching
cross-examination which she had
rather uneasily looked forward to.</p>

<p>"You had better put on your
bonnet and have a drive," the
young lady proceeded, pausing with
her hand on the door. "It will
do you good, after being in the
house so much. I don't want the
horses taken out, and they will
only scratch holes in the gravel
if they stand here doing nothing.
I am not going away till dinner
time."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[257]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear, I think
I will," said Mrs. Hardy. Mrs.
Reade went upstairs to Rachel's
room, and without knocking, opened
the door softly.</p>

<p>It was a bright January afternoon,
but the heat of the day
was over, and a sea breeze was
springing up. The window was open,
and the chintz curtains softly rustling
to and fro. There was a
magnificent bouquet on a table at the
foot of the bed; the air was full of
the perfume of roses; a few flies were
buzzing over a plate of strawberries
set on a chair at Rachel's side.</p>

<p>The invalid was lying on a sofa,
in a white dressing-gown, in an
attitude of extreme languor, asleep.
One hand holding a fan had<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
dropped beside her; the other was
under her head. Her dark gold
hair was loose and tumbled, and
curling in damp rings on her temples;
her face was flushed and thin; there
were hollows and shadows under the
tired closed eyes. She looked as if
she had been ill for months.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade, examining her attentively
as she knelt by the sofa,
was deeply shocked and concerned.
Never would she have gone away
to Adelonga if she could have foreseen
this! And never should the
poor little thing be harried and
worried, as she had evidently been,
again, if <i>she</i> had any power to
prevent it&mdash;no, not though twenty
Mr. Kingstons and all their twenty
fortunes were at stake.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

<p>A mosquito settled upon the girl's
white arm, and the light brush of the
finger that removed it wakened her.
She drew a deep breath, and opened
her eyes languidly; then seeing her
visitor, she stared at her for a
second in a dazed and startled
way; and then to Mrs. Reade's
great embarrassment and distress,
she suddenly flung herself into her
arms, and broke into the wildest
weeping.</p>

<p>"Now, Rachel! Now, my dearest
child&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But it would have been as hopeless
to try and stop the Falls of Niagara
as this tide of passion at the flood;
seeing which, Mrs. Reade waited for
the ebb in silence. By the time it
came the girl was completely exhausted;<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
she seemed to have the merest fragment
of strength.</p>

<p>"Now," said Beatrice, when she had
sponged her face and hands and otherwise
taken steps to revive and soothe
her, "now tell me what all this is
about. I know you are in some great
trouble, and I have come home on purpose
to help you."</p>

<p>"No one can help me!" Rachel cried,
despairingly, tears rushing afresh into
her hot eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense. Just tell me what
is the matter, and see if I can't.
Are they trying to make you marry
Mr. Kingston? Because I can soon
send <i>him</i> about his business."</p>

<p>"No; Mr. Kingston is very kind
<i>now</i>. He sends me flowers every day.
He does not worry me. He is very<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
considerate and thoughtful. For I think
he&mdash;knows."</p>

<p>"Well, and now I want to know.
Is it about&mdash;someone else? Is it about
Mr. Dalrymple?"</p>

<p>"Who told you?" the girl demanded,
with sharp entreaty. "Oh, Beatrice,
what have you heard? Did Mrs. Digby
tell you anything about him? Is he
in Queensland? Is he alive? What is
he doing?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade replied that she had
heard nothing of Mr. Dalrymple beyond the
fact that he was believed to be in
Queensland, and doing well.</p>

<p>"If he had not been, they must
have known," said Rachel. "Oh, my
love, if I could see you for myself
just once."</p>

<p>She began to cry again, more bitterly<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
than before, and to wring her hands.
There was a fierce excitement in her
grief and despair that for a moment
stunned the little woman who had
never known what it was to be in
love.</p>

<p>And then Rachel told all the story
of her clandestine engagement, as the
reader already knows it, without any
reservations. The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> was exactly
what Mrs. Reade expected&mdash;"And
he never came!"</p>

<p>"Poor little thing!" she ejaculated
pitifully.</p>

<p>"I was as certain that he would
come as that Christmas would come,"
said Rachel, reckless in her confessions
now that she had begun to open her
heart. "And there <i>was</i> a strange gentleman
here, and he was shut up a<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
long time with Aunt Elizabeth, and I
thought it was he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was not he?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. When he was going
away I ran out into the garden and
watched for him; he was an ugly <i>little</i>
man. And if it had been Roden, and
he had wanted to see me, <i>he</i> would not
have allowed himself to be sent away."</p>

<p>"That would have depended on
mamma; wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He would never have let
her send him away; and Aunt Elizabeth
says, solemnly, that he never came."</p>

<p>"You told <i>her</i> about him then?" asked
Mrs. Reade.</p>

<p>"Beatrice, I was nearly mad&mdash;I don't
know what I said. She was very
angry&mdash;she always hated him. But I
did not care&mdash;I was too miserable to<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
care. And I made her <i>swear</i> that he
had never come; and now&mdash;it is nearly
February&mdash;now I know he didn't. I
don't want anybody to tell me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade put all these revelations
into her mental crucible, and in a few
seconds she had the product ready. On
presenting it to Rachel, wrapped up
in the gentlest language, it came to this
simply&mdash;that "it was always the way
with men of that kind."</p>

<p>"He is not like other men," said
Rachel. "I do not blame him. I
have thought of it, over and over and
over, every night and every day, and
I know why it was. I <i>ran after him</i>,
Beatrice&mdash;I took him before he offered
himself to me&mdash;I had only seen him
once or twice when I showed him I
loved him, and made him think I wanted<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
him&mdash;he did not ask me to be his
wife until I had given myself to him
already! I did not think of it then,
but I see it clearly now. I dragged
him into it&mdash;I gave him no choice.
And now he is away, and he thinks
about it, and he knows I am not
enough for him. How should I be
enough&mdash;<i>I</i> for such a man as that?
Oh, that happy woman, who died in his
arms! Oh, how I wish I had been she!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Reade, after a
pause, trying to speak cheerfully, but
feeling profoundly disheartened; "you
ought not to have had anything to do
with lovers and marriages at your time
of life, and you must just give up
thinking of such things until you are
older and wiser."</p>

<p>"I shall never give <i>him</i> up," said<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
Rachel quietly; "never, if I live to be
a hundred. I have told Aunt Elizabeth&mdash;I
told her to tell Mr. Kingston&mdash;that
I shall never love any other man.
It would be impossible, after loving
him. When I am well I shall ask her
to let me go out and be a governess,
and earn my own living. I don't want
to be rich, I want to be poor, like
him. And some day, perhaps, I may
see him again, and be able to do
something for him&mdash;if it isn't till he is
an old, old man, I don't care. If only
God lets him live and lets me live, so
that we are both in the world together&mdash;I'll
take my chance of the rest.
But&mdash;but," and she turned her head
from side to side, and began to tremble
and cry in a weak, hysterical
abandonment of all self-command, "if I<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
have to wait for years and years, without
a sight of his face or a sound of
his voice, how shall I be able to live?
The longing for him will kill me!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade went away when her
carriage returned, more humble-minded
than she had been in her life. She
wanted very much to stay and nurse
her cousin until she was better, but
she could not do that, because she could
not trust Ned to keep house and keep
sober by himself; so she set off to see
the doctor to get a confidential report
of the "case," meaning to intimate her
suspicions that there was a touch of
fever on the brain, and to gain his
sanction to a scheme for removing the
invalid to her own cheerful abode at
South Yarra as soon as she became
moderately convalescent.</p>

<p class="h3">RACHEL ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF MARRIAGE.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/d-p.jpg" alt="P"  height="96" width="80" />
  <span class="hide">P</span>ROBABLY no girl of nineteen&mdash;probably
no man or woman
of any age&mdash;ever died of a
broken heart, unless when that complaint
was complicated and aggravated
by the presence of physical disease of
some sort.</p>

<p>Rachel's constitution was sound, albeit
her nervous organisation was extremely
delicate, and she did not die, neither
under this bitter first blow, nor later<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
on, when she had still sharper provocations.</p>

<p>A little tender petting and coddling
at the hands of her cousin Beatrice, who
was now her devoted ally and friend,
did more to restore her than all the
doctor's medicines and all her aunt's
jellies and broths.</p>

<p>The very talking of her troubles eased
and soothed her, and gave her a
sense of refreshment and rest, and
though Beatrice offered her no encouragement
on Mr. Dalrymple's behalf&mdash;and
indeed hinted pretty broadly that
the terrible thing which had happened
was an inevitable sequel and corrective
to a lapse of reason that partook of
the character of temporary insanity, to
say the least of it&mdash;she was heartily
if not demonstratively sympathetic.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[270]</span></p>

<p>Within a fortnight of her cousin's
return she reached that stage of convalescence
which made the removal to
South Yarra justifiable, and in the
doctor's opinion expedient.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade had great difficulty in
carrying out this little enterprise. Her
mother had never shown herself so impracticable.</p>

<p>She was determined not to let Rachel
out of her sight, she said; and she
stuck to that determination against
many artful man&oelig;uvres so steadily that
the powerful small woman, little accustomed
to be thwarted, and still less
to own to it, nearly made up
her mind to confess herself beaten,
and to break the disappointment to
Rachel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy, however, relented in a<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
sudden and unexpected manner. She
received a consignment of furniture and
<i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i> from her travelling daughter,
together with most interesting and bewildering
advices.</p>

<p>Laura wrote to say that the Toorak
House, if it had any respect for itself,
must immediately get rid of its pierglasses,
its whitewash, and its aniline
colours; and poor Mrs. Hardy, who
had ever walked with the complacent
dignity of a priestess and oracle in the
sacred regions of household art, was
too much excited and disturbed by the
humiliating discovery that she was old-fashioned
and behind the times, and
by her agonising desire to recover
her proper position, to pay the customary
attention even to Rachel's
business.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>While she was absorbed in beginning
the mighty task of re-adjusting her
ideas of taste and the details of her
domestic environment, which, after a
few years of painful struggle with the
impracticabilities of Eastlake medi&aelig;valism,
was to result in the existing
combination of Chippendale and the
Japanesque, she felt that it would be a
relief to divest herself of superfluous cares.</p>

<p>So she laid her daughter under solemn
obligations to protect Rachel's interests
and the honour of the family, and
allowed her to take the invalid away
with her for a week or two, that
so she might give her undivided
attention to the choice of new coverings
for the drawing-room furniture, and the
question what should be done to the
ceiling.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[273]</span></p>

<p>The two young women were very
grateful for the chance which set them
free to follow their own devices. Mrs.
Reade brought her new brougham&mdash;a
propitiatory offering from Ned after
he had scandalously disgraced himself
by going to a public dinner and coming
home in a dishevelled condition at noon
next day&mdash;and conveyed her charge to
South Yarra in a nest of soft cushions,
and laid her on a pillowy sofa in the
brightest of homely boudoirs, where
they discussed the situation and afternoon
tea with much content and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Rachel was strangely peaceful and
amiable at this time. She puzzled her
companion excessively. She had, indeed,
a sort of exalted transcendentalism about
her that was almost aggravating to that<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
practical and most unsentimental person.
Her way of moralising upon love and
lovers, after such an experience as she
had had, was very na&iuml;ve and touching,
but eminently preposterous, Mrs. Reade
considered&mdash;and she did not at all mind
saying so.</p>

<p>"A lover who is unfaithful does the
deadliest dishonour that is possible to
love, in <i>my</i> opinion," said she, with her
customary air of decision. "To break
<i>any</i> pledge is bad enough, but to
break <i>that</i> pledge ought to disqualify a
man from ever again calling himself a
man."</p>

<p>"I do not think there should be any
pledges in love, either given or asked
for," said Rachel softly. "Love is not
a thing to be tied and bound. Fancy a
man feeling that he <i>had</i> to keep a<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
promise if he did not wish to do it!
And, oh! fancy a woman letting him&mdash;being
deceived into letting him make a
sacrifice for her! It would be an outrage
and a degradation to both of them. I
think Roden&mdash;Mr. Dalrymple&mdash;is above
that, Beatrice."</p>

<p>From all she had heard, Mrs. Reade
was decidedly disposed to think so
too.</p>

<p>"He says that they are a curse upon
people's lives&mdash;those engagements that
are kept," continued Rachel, looking
solemnly out of the window with her
pensive eyes.</p>

<p>"Did he tell you that? Dear me,
he must be a most extraordinary man."</p>

<p>"I understand it perfectly&mdash;I know
what he means. When we love one
another we are not responsible; something<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
in us makes us do it. When we
leave off loving&mdash;when we get dissatisfied&mdash;we
can't help it either. It is nature
that tells us to do the one as well as
the other; and nature should be obeyed,
Roden says."</p>

<p>Mrs. Reade made no comment upon
this, but thought to herself that it was a
remarkably wise provision of nature&mdash;under
the circumstances&mdash;that her devotee
was endowed with the courage of his convictions.</p>

<p>"It is very hard for me now, but
it is the truest kindness and gentleness
on his part," the girl went on, with a
tremor in her quiet voice. "He knows
we understand each other better than
any one else can do. I think some
day he will come and tell me all
about it&mdash;when he thinks I can bear<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
it; how he could not help it; that that
other woman's memory was more to
him than any new love a few days
old could be, and how he was true
to her and to himself, and to me, not
to wrong any of us any further to gratify
my foolishness. It will be something
of that sort, I know; it will be
nothing that is a disgrace to him.
Ah, Beatrice, you think I am talking
childish nonsense, I see it in your
face."</p>

<p>"I certainly do, my dear. I think you
are fully qualified for admission into the
Yarra Bend, if you wish for the candid
truth."</p>

<p>"No; you don't know him, and I do.
I am puzzled, I don't deny that I am
puzzled a little; but I <i>trust</i> him. He
may do what he likes; I shall never<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
think that he will do anything wrong.
Some day it will be explained, and I
shall see that he was right. I shall
love him the more for not being afraid
to break off with me when he felt it
was a mistake. Under any circumstances
I love him too well not to be
thankful I am spared the misery of
seeing him suffer from an irksome marriage
that could not satisfy him. And
love&mdash;as he and I understand love&mdash;would
be degraded by vulgar efforts to
keep it under lock and key."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it occurs to
you," remarked Beatrice, with her head
on one side; "but it is a very dangerous
doctrine that you and Mr. Dalrymple
seem to believe in. Logically worked
out, it leads&mdash;goodness knows where it
<i>doesn't</i> lead to."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[279]</span></p>

<p>The blood flew over the girl's pale
face. She was the most sensitively
delicate, the most maidenly, of girls;
and she scented a meaning in her cousin's
words that shocked her terribly.</p>

<p>"I am sure that cannot be," she
said, with a majestic gentleness that
was full of severe reproach.</p>

<p>"You don't imply that husbands and
wives, when they are tired of each
other&mdash;or even when only one is tired&mdash;are
at liberty to make fresh combinations?"</p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> I am not alluding to
married people, Beatrice. They are like
nuns who have taken the veil; they
have nothing to do with&mdash;with&mdash;such
things as we have been speaking of."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed&mdash;haven't they?"</p>

<p>"They are in a sacred place. They<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
are out of the common world&mdash;out of
the arena, so to speak. They have
taken their prizes, and gone to sit with
the spectators. Even if they do marry
wrongly, and do not love each other
afterwards, in the fullest way, after
such a dedication as they have
made&mdash;with such ties and confidences,
and intimacies between them, so sacred,
and so close, and so delicate, and so&mdash;so&mdash;oh,
Beatrice, don't look at me
like that! You know what I mean."</p>

<p>"I am trying to follow you, dear."</p>

<p>"You are married yourself, and you
know how it is&mdash;better than I do. Yet
<i>I</i> know, too. If I were married&mdash;if I
were Roden's wife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would lie down at his feet
and let him clean his boots on you, if
there did not happen to be a door-mat<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
handy&mdash;oh, yes, I quite understand
<i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"I would never make demands upon
him that he should love me always,"
the girl proceeded, with a gentle
solemnity that this kind of flippant
witticism could not discompose. "I
would never even ask him if he loved
me. It would seem to me a coarse and
insulting question, and it would tempt
him to doubt whether he did. If he
went away from me, I would never say
to him, 'Write to me often&mdash;write me
long letters.' It is so stupid of people
to do that! Of course, if he wanted
to, he would; and if he did it because
he was asked, his letters would be valueless,
and worse. He should never have
to think of me as a mortgage on his
life and his happiness&mdash;he should do<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
as he liked&mdash;he should love me as he
liked. And if ever he left off loving
me, I should know he could not help
it&mdash;I should not blame him&mdash;I should
not ask him why. I should <i>feel</i> it in
a moment&mdash;I am sure, long before he
did&mdash;as one feels a chill in the air
when the sun goes in, even if one's
eyes are shut; but I should never say
a word about it. And yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet it would never occur to
him, you think, to provide himself with
a more congenial companion?"</p>

<p>"Beatrice, I cannot talk to you, if
you make those suggestions."</p>

<p>"I am only making your own suggestions,
my dear. You said it was a
degradation to love to keep it under
lock and key."</p>

<p>"And I said I was not speaking of<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
married people. You <i>know</i> there is
something&mdash;whole worlds of things&mdash;besides
love to be considered in their case."</p>

<p>"Married people are just as human
as single people&mdash;and so, for the matter
of that, are nuns who have taken the
veil, I suppose. Vows, if I understand
you rightly, are immoral; and the
dictates of nature should be obeyed.
Nature is uncommonly likely to dictate
to man who is not in love with his
wife that there might possibly exist a
more desirable woman."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to explain
myself," said Rachel, who felt herself
in a distressing entanglement, and yet
was conscious that her principles were
being utterly misconstrued; "but I
know that <i>that</i>&mdash;what you allude to&mdash;would
be an impossibility."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[284]</span></p>

<p>"Well, I daresay it would," said Mrs.
Reade, after a pause. She was suddenly
struck with the impropriety of
insisting upon strict logic in the discussion
of these delicate matters, all
things considered. Yet she was not
quite content to leave off at this point.</p>

<p>"Put Mr. Dalrymple aside, Rachel.
Suppose you were yourself married, not
to him, but to someone you did not
particularly care for?"</p>

<p>"That could never be," the girl replied
quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. It was very
nearly being, I may take leave to remind
you. None of us can forsee what will
happen, and 'never' is a ridiculous word
for a child like you to use. You will
not live an old maid for fifty or sixty
years because you are disappointed in<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
a lover whom you have known for a
few days&mdash;don't you believe it."</p>

<p>"I will make no vows," said Rachel
with a faint smile; "but I express to
you my sincere conviction that I shall
never marry anybody. If I do&mdash;and I
can't say I <i>wish</i> to be an old maid&mdash;I
shall tell the person, whoever he is, all
about Roden, frankly."</p>

<p>"Of course you will. And very
probably he will like you the better for
that frankness, and be quite willing to
take you on your own terms. But
then, suppose after years of married
life Mr. Dalrymple turned up again, and
you found you felt towards him as you
do now&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"What then?" repeated the girl,
much disturbed and a little affronted;
"I should not recognise that I felt so."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[286]</span></p>

<p>"But suppose&mdash;for the sake of argument&mdash;that
you could not help yourself?"</p>

<p>"I hope I could help it, Beatrice. I
should not allow him to remind me of
the past."</p>

<p>"Would not the past suggest itself
sufficiently? Ah, my dear, he is a very
strong man! And you are as weak as&mdash;well,
we needn't say anything about
that. If he wanted your love back, and
you had it in your heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he did," interposed Rachel; "but
I know he never would&mdash;I should love
him no more."</p>

<p>"Would that be in accordance with
the terms of your philosophy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it would. For nature makes
us with many capacities. Some of them
counteract the others. Don't talk of these
things any more, Beatrice&mdash;I don't like it."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[287]</span></p>

<p>"Very well, dear; I won't."</p>

<p>The little lady got up from her seat
on the floor, opened a window, put the
teacups on the table, and asked her
cousin if she had seen the beautiful
Persian tiles that Mr. Kingston had
just had sent out to him for one of
the dados in the new house.</p>

<p>Rachel responded absently, gazed for
a little while in silence upon the sleepy
garden full of flowers and humming
bees, and as Mrs. Reade had expected,
returned herself to the abandoned topic.</p>

<p>"At any rate," she said thoughtfully,
"there is one thing I would always do.
I would tell the truth. I would never
have secrets. I would sooner do the
wrongest thing, the wickedest crime,
than hide it. If I <i>feel</i> things in my
heart&mdash;well, my husband, if I have one,<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
shall know all that I know. And I
will never do anything that he&mdash;that the
whole world&mdash;may not see."</p>

<p>"Does that seem to you so easy?"
inquired Beatrice, settling a top-heavy
rosebud in a slender Venetian vase.
"Did you never have any secrets that
you were afraid to tell?"</p>

<p>The girl was silent for several minutes.
She was crimson to the throat, and her
face was turned away from her companion.</p>

<p>"I will do what is sure to be right
and&mdash;safe," she said at last, falteringly;
"I will never marry anybody, if I do
not marry Roden."</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
